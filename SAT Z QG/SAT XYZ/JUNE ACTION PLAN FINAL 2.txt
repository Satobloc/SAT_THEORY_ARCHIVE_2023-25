1. Core Theory & Foundations
Finalize “Mecha Z” Lagrangian (SAT Z v1)

Enumerate every dimension-4 operator consistent with the final Ontology Z (kinetic/self-couplings for θ₄, ψ, τ, uᵘ; all emergent gauge terms; any ϕ_Z couplings).

Write each operator with an “origin: (Z Module #)” tag and produce a LaTeX draft of L_{SAT Z}.

Check reality/CPT: ensure no complex coefficients appear.

Confirm decoupling limit: if ϕ_Z→0, recover SAT xy exactly.

(These belong under “Write Mecha Z (SAT Z Lagrangian v1)” in Core Theory.)

Decide on any extra Z-only field ϕ_Z and higher/form symmetries

If ϕ_Z is introduced (e.g. a radial θ₄ modulus or a 2-form C_{μν}), write Axiom Z10 specifying its transformation and periodicity.

If adding a discrete/higher-form symmetry beyond ℤ₃ (e.g. a ℤ₄ “axion” or 2-form gauge), write the corresponding periodicity axiom (analogous to Z1/Z5).

Commit and lock Ontology_Z_v1.txt once finalized.

Lock down Ontology QG choices (Metric Decision)

Decide between “Fundamental metric g_{μν}” vs. “Emergent ĝ_{μν}(θ₄,uᵘ).”

If Fundamental, prepare S_EH + S_{SAT Z}(θ₄,ψ,τ,uᵘ; g_{μν}).

If Emergent, define precisely the composite operator ĝ_{μν}(θ₄,uᵘ) and show how (approximate) diffeomorphism invariance arises.

Write and commit Ontology_QG_v1.txt capturing that decision (and any sub-axioms).

Choose whether uᵘ becomes an operator or remains classical in our quantization.

Pick between full diffeo-invariance vs. a Horava-like preferred foliation (and, if Horava, choose the anisotropic‐scaling exponent z).

Decide on τ-sector treatment: sum over ℤ₃ flat connections vs. freeze τ everywhere.

Reproduce Newtonian/GR Physics (complete derivation)

Finalize the derivation of the Newtonian (weak-field) limit from θ₄ ∇·u.

Explicitly solve for the emergent Schwarzschild metric from the full SAT strain tensor.

(Addendum 2 notes we still need a “full PDE solve → geodesic integrate → data-fit” cycle for Mercury’s orbit.)

2. Quantization
Quant Z (Cosmological/Black-Hole Backgrounds)

Write down the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in the chosen QG ontology (still “Planned”).

Construct the full path-integral formulation and compute 1-loop β-functions (asymptotic safety search).

Quant QG (Gravity Included or Emergent)

Finalize the canonical vs. path-integral split for Quantum Gravity, including gravitational coupling (Case A: fundamental g_{μν}) or emergent-metric/discrete-graph (Case B).

Provide an explicit 1-loop renormalizability proof (item 19 in the June plan).

(These quantization tasks were flagged as “Planned” in Addendum 2 but need to be slotted into our Quant roadmap.)

3. Standard Model & Bridge
Higgs-Mechanism Analog and Neutrino Sector

Flesh out how ψ or θ₄ acts as a Higgs-like condensate (the skeleton exists, but the “Higgs analog” is still incomplete).

Complete the full mapping of neutrino masses/mixings via ψ-holonomy.

Fully demonstrate B–L symmetry (currently only sketched).

Build out all Yukawa-like effective couplings, including any flavor-violation predictions.

Nuclear Interactions Submodules

Sₚₚ calculation: compute the ψ-sector contribution to p + p → D + e⁺ + ν (including Gamow-peak corrections from θ₄ mixing).

Chiral EFT → NN potential: construct the proton–proton and nucleon–nucleon scattering submodule, derive all ⟨σv⟩ for CNO reactions and D-burning.

Fission PES: build first-principles potential-energy surfaces for nuclear fission.

Nuclear-reaction network: assemble the full set of reaction rates ϵ(ρ,T,X) from SAT’s ψ-sector cross-sections.

(These were noted as incomplete in Addendum 2 and should slot under “Standard Model & Bridge” in our June plan.)

Baryogenesis & CP-Violation Modeling

Flesh out a detailed SAT model of θ₄–ψ–τ coupling as the origin of CP violation and baryon asymmetry; compute relevant Sakharov-criterion parameters.

(Most of these were marked “Planned” or “Incomplete” in Addendum 2/3 and should slot under Section 4 of our June plan.)
