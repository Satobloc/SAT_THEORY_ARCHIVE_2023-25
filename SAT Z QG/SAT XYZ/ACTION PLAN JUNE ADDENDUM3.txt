Complete SATxy Index is Skeleton Exists or To be fleshed out. It needs outline completion and cross-links filled.
◦
Final Review / Gap Analysis is Pending. It is slated to begin once the quantization and SM embedding tasks are complete.
◦
Outreach & Public Documentation is Early Drafts. While not a core scientific goal, it needs finishing touches. This involves developing the public-facing narrative and metaphors.

Outreach Z module outline is sketched/Planned. Specific deliverables needed:
▪
Outreach Z: Executive Summary: draft 1-page overview.
▪
Outreach Z: Formal Overview: draft 5-page doc.
