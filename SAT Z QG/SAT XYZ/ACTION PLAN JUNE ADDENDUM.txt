This list represents the areas requiring further work or development in the SATxy project, based on the information available:
•
Core Theory and Foundations
◦
No additional “Z-only” fields (ϕ_Z) have yet been introduced.
◦
Finalize Ontology Z: decide on any extra fields or symmetries, including deciding on ϕ_Z, choosing symmetry beyond ℤ₃, and committing the Ontology_Z_v1.txt file.
◦
Write full Yukawa sector (SM & exotic fermions). Finish writing out all couplings (including gauge fermions, Yukawa terms, topological θ₄ F F̃ terms).
◦
The complete SATxy Lagrangian (including terms beyond the core dynamical equations) needs to be finished. Systematically assemble kinetic, potential, and coupling terms for θ₄, ψ, τ, emergent gauge fields, and embedded SM fields.
◦
Lagrangian per Z-only fields remains open.
◦
Lock Ontology QG (Metric Decision): Choose between “Fundamental Metric” vs. “Emergent Metric,” prepare actions accordingly, write Ontology_QG_v1.txt, and commit QG branches.
◦
uᵘ Status: Decide between Operator vs. Classical approximation.
◦
Symmetry Choice: Decide between Full Diff invariance vs. Horava foliation.
◦
τ-Sector Treatment: Decide between Sum over ℤ₃ flat connections vs. freeze τ.
◦
Explicit field solutions remain open.
◦
Reproduction of Newtonian/GR Physics is Partial; the full derivation needs finalization, specifically deriving the Newtonian and GR limit from the SAT strain tensor. This includes the task to Derive the emergent Schwarzschild metric.
•
Quantization
◦
Quantization on curved backgrounds (e.g., cosmological or black hole spacetimes, specifically FLRW) is a proposed next theoretical task.
◦
Write Wheeler–DeWitt (Quant Z). (Status: Planned).
◦
Path integral 1-loop β-functions (Quant Z). (Status: Planned).
◦
Search Asymptotic Safety (Quant Z). (Status: Planned).
◦
Quant QG: Canonical vs. Path integral. Quant QG module status is Planned (outline).
◦
Path Integral Formulation is Pending or In Progress in various lists and needs explicit construction and showing equivalence to canonical quantization.
◦
1-loop renormalizability proof (Item 19).
•
Standard Model and Bridge
◦
Higgs Mechanism Analog is Not Yet complete; the structure for ψ or θ₄ to act as a Higgs-like condensate is not complete. Need deeper work on Higgs physics.
◦
Neutrino Sector is Not Yet complete; there is no full mapping of neutrino masses/mixing yet, and neutrino ψ-holonomy needs work.
◦
Baryon/Lepton Number is only a Sketch; the full B–L symmetry has not yet been shown.
◦
Building Yukawa-like effective couplings and predicting flavor violation probabilities are related tasks, and extending Yukawa couplings is mentioned.

Predictions and Phenomenology
◦
The actual formulas, numerical forecasts, and error bars still need to be computed for some predictions (e.g., ℤ₃ confinement, weak-field GW deviations, neutrino-oscillation anomalies).
◦
Compute specific predictions like clock-drift vs. ∇θ₄, domain-wall interferometer phase maps, pulsar-timing templates, and neutrino-oscillation holonomy predictions. Clock-drift & lab interferometer design is specifically listed as Item 17.

◦
Develop a full SAT-based cosmological constant or inflationary model (listed as Item 15).
