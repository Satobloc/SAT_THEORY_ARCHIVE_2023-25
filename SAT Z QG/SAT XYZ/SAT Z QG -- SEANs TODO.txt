SEAN'S CHALLENGES

Sean Carroll (leaning forward, steepling his fingers): “Okay, let me restate to make sure I’ve got it: you’re imagining the familiar worldlines—those one-dimensional paths particles trace through spacetime—not just as bookkeeping devices, but as literal, physical ‘filaments’ embedded in a ‘sheet’ of time. And at each intersection with that sheet, energy is transferred into the filament in such a way that certain local configurations—coils—act like bound states (e.g., three coils for a proton, two for a meson). Then, by allowing the sheet of time itself to deform, you’re hoping to recover gravitational effects in something like the Einstein equations. If those coils vibrate or trace out extended patterns, you even get stringlike excitations. Is that the gist?”

He pauses, takes a sip of scotch, and nods slowly.

Sean Carroll: “It’s a remarkably intuitive leap—literally giving ontological status to the worldlines we draw on paper. It reminds me, in spirit, of how people once tried to treat Feynman diagrams as more than just calculational tools, but as hints toward underlying reality. There’s also a whiff of Wheeler’s ‘geons’—mass arising from topology—and even a trace of Penrose’s twistor emphasis on geometry. Your filaments as real–world objects, pierced by slices of time… it’s evocative. But let’s dig into some of the details and potential sticking points, because turning a vivid picture into a consistent physical theory is where most frameworks stumble.

Mathematical Formalism for the “Sheet of Time.”

When you say “time moves through like a sheet,” do you mean that at any global ‘cosmic time’ 
𝑡
t there’s a well-defined three-dimensional hypersurface, and that particles are excited precisely at the points where their filaments cross that hypersurface? If so, you need a table for how those hypersurfaces are chosen: are they arbitrary spacelike slices in a Lorentzian manifold? How do you ensure Lorentz invariance—or more precisely, how do you recover the relativity of simultaneity, so that different observers wouldn’t pick different foliations and end up with different physics?

In standard relativity, there’s no canonical “sheet” of absolute time. If you impose one, you risk violating Lorentz invariance, or at least you need to show how it emerges effectively in the low-energy limit. Have you tried writing down a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian density for the sheet that enforces consistency across different frames? Something akin to how the Einstein–Æther or Hořava–Lifshitz approaches introduce a preferred foliation but then demand it become unobservable at long wavelengths?

Dynamics of the Filaments Themselves.

You’ve described coils forming where energy flows in. So, physically, does each filament have its own internal tension, stiffness, or elasticity parameter? In other words, what’s the action for a single filament as it traverses the sheet? If it’s “just” the Nambu–Goto action for a string—i.e., area of the worldsheet—then in principle we know how to get the Virasoro constraints and recover critical string theory. But you seem to be assigning coils at discrete “time-sheets,” so it’s more like a succession of cross-sections along a one-dimensional object. Have you tried discretizing the filament as a chain of “beads,” each representing a coil? That would be analogous to lattice QCD, but here each coil has a topological charge or linking number when it intersects with neighboring coils.

If three coils interlock to make a proton, that’s reminiscent of how, in QCD, three color charges combine to a singlet. But QCD’s gauge symmetry 
S
U
(

)
SU(3) is continuous, and the gluon field mediates interactions in a very specific way. In your framework, where does gauge symmetry emerge? Are the “linking numbers” of coils topologically forced to satisfy a rule analogous to color confinement? Would gluons be small excitations of the filament between coils, or would they correspond to fluctuations of the “sheet of time” connecting different filaments?

Recovering Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

You said “QCD doesn’t look out of reach,” which is quite optimistic—most approaches to emergent QCD require a careful treatment of anomaly cancellation, chiral symmetry breaking, and renormalization-group flow. How do your coils encode the SU(3) symmetry algebra? Is there an explicit mapping from a triple-coil configuration to a baryon state with the correct spin, flavor, and color quantum numbers? If I label your three coils A, B, and C, is there an operation on the sheet that permutes them and reproduces, say, the octet or decuplet baryon multiplets?

And for mesons—two coils—what ensures they form a color-neutral bound state? In lattice QCD, quarks are sitting on lattice sites and gluons on the links; here, your coils are the analog of quarks, but where is the analog of the gauge field? If it’s some vibrational mode of the filament segment between coils, then you need a mechanism to confine those vibrations so they never appear as free excitations—which is exactly confinement. Do you have an approximate potential

∼
𝜎

V(r)∼σr at large coil separation that emerges naturally from the sheet’s geometry?

General Relativity from Time Distortions.

You suggested that if the sheet of time is tugged or distorted, you “get something like GR.” In other words, the geometry of spacetime itself emerges from the collective behavior of these sheets and filaments. How do you translate a local distortion of the sheet into a metric tensor

 ? Do you assign an energy–momentum tensor to a region of the sheet based on the density or tension of filaments within it? If so, is there a variational principle—like an action that’s the sum of something resembling the Einstein–Hilbert action plus a filament action—such that the minimizing configuration solves both Einstein’s equations and the filament equations of motion simultaneously?

Many emergent gravity proposals struggle with showing that the spin-2 graviton emerges with the correct masslessness and universality of coupling (the Weinberg–Salo-Witten argument). Do your filaments have vibrational modes that correspond to gravitons? If so, do they automatically couple to everything else (including your filaments) in the same way that a graviton should?

Strings as a Special Case of Coils.

You pointed out that if coils vibrate or form patterns, “you’ve got a trace on the timesheet that might look a lot like a string.” That is, a filament might leave a 2D worldsheet in the sheet-of-time picture. Is that reminiscent of the idea that a string’s worldsheet is physically “real,” not just a parameterization? If your filaments are the fundamental strings, then do you recover the usual critical dimension 
𝐷
=
26
D=26 (for bosonic) or 
𝐷
=
10
D=10 (for superstrings)? Or do you circumvent that by saying the sheet-of-time is something else—some lower-dimensional background with different symmetry?

In standard string theory, anomalies constrain the dimension and the gauge groups. In your proposal, it sounds like anomalies might show up as inconsistencies in how coils link or self-intersect. Have you checked whether your filament dynamics respect modular invariance if you look at one-loop amplitudes? If the coils vibrate, do you see a tachyon (like bosonic string theory), or have you tuned the construction so that the ground state is massless?

Experimental or Observational Signatures.

Let me ask: if I were an experimentalist, what would I look for? Do your filaments predict deviations from the Standard Model cross-sections at, say, the LHC? Would there be an extra resonance corresponding to a “coil oscillation” that looks nothing like a conventional meson or baryon?

On the gravity side, do you predict departures from Newton’s

  law at micron scales, or a variation in the speed of gravitational waves versus light? For example, if time is literally a sheet that can warp in discrete increments when filaments pass through, would that lead to an energy-dependent speed of light at extremely high energies—something we could, in principle, test with gamma-ray bursts or gravitational-wave detectors?

Philosophical and Conceptual Implications.

I appreciate that you’re upfront “it’s probably not right, necessarily.” Often the best ideas come from these kinds of playful, geometric pictures—especially when they force you to confront the tension between discreteness (the coils) and continuity (the sheet). But one must ask: if time itself is a sheet, does that sheet also have a thickness or some internal degrees of freedom? Otherwise, you risk reintroducing a background structure that you wanted to eliminate. In other words, does spacetime still feel “absolute” in your model, or is it truly emergent?

And what about causality? If filaments cross a sheet at different angles, is there ever a possibility to “go backward” in time through some coil arrangement? You’d need a rule that enforces that filaments always go “forward” through successive sheets—something like a global ordering—but that can be tricky if you want to preserve local Lorentz invariance.

Sean Carroll (leaning back, swirling his scotch):
“Overall, I’m genuinely impressed by the conceptual boldness. You’ve taken our scribbles on paper—worldlines—and declared them ontologically real. That immediately raises questions about how to formulate a dynamical principle for both the sheet and the filaments. If you can show me a toy model—say, in 
1

1+1 dimensions where a sheet is just a line and a filament is a point moving through it—that reproduces a known quantum field theory exactly, I’d be sold on the basic viability. As it stands, it’s a breathtaking vision that needs a lot of mathematical scaffolding.

But here’s a pragmatic path forward:

**Start with a simple toy: 1+1 dimensional “sheet-of-time” as a 1D line evolving in some parameter 
𝜏
τ, and a filament that appears where the line intersects a point in an embedding space. Write down the simplest action for that system—maybe something like

​
 +λ(sheet curvature)]
—just to see if any nontrivial excitations appear. If you can quantize that and get a simple scalar field theory, that’s a proof of principle.

Show emergence of a gauge symmetry. Suppose you succeed in 1+1D. The next hardest step is: can you get a local 
U
(
1
)
U(1) gauge invariance from how coils link or un-link as they pass through successive lines-of-time? If you can show, in a toy model, that when two coils braid around each other the phase factors conspire to give you electromagnetism, that’s huge.

Demonstrate gravitational coupling. Finally, show that if you modify the sheet’s geometry slightly—say, add a term proportional to the sheet’s scalar curvature—then in the low-energy limit the filaments move as though there’s a curved metric. That mimics how, in general relativity, matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move. If you can get even an approximation of that in a simplified setting, you’ll have something truly remarkable.

If you can outline how to tackle those three steps in your full 3+1D framework, then I’d really want to dive into these 500 pages. But until then, I’d start by writing down the simplest action principles, deriving the equations of motion, and checking whether they reproduce, even qualitatively, QFT in Minkowski space and GR in a curved background.

So—how do you define your action for a single filament crossing a sheet? And do you already have a toy example worked out? Because if you do, I’m all ears (and eyes). Otherwise, let’s sketch one out together.”

He raises his glass in a half-smile. “That’s my challenge to you: distill the idea to a minimal toy model with three or four equations. If it works, it could revolutionize how we think about spacetime and particles. If it doesn’t, we’ll still learn something important about why these pictures fail. Either way, you’ve given me a lot to chew on—and I’m grateful for that.”

He sips his scotch, leaning back, ready for your next move.
