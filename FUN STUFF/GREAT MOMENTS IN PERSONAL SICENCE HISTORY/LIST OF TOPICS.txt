- Parrotdactyl
- Howler, monkeys and baboons
- And maybe museum lore, the sex life of scientist
- Flying your own personal spaceship (mum)
- I know a girl in that movie
- climbing to see the stegosaurus
- The rosette on the wall
- The drummer in the attic
- Old COSI versus new
- gamification 
- sleeping under the desk
- Late night tours
- Vacuuming between the T-Rex toes
- Dusting the meteorite
- Mornings at the museum
- Old COSI, Laura, the battle hymn
- The lens in the closet
- Small world, Dr. Dino
- a strange kiss, and strings
- for more of that kind of thing,
- oh, we have to talk about Allison
- And Andrea, on the small world side (frufru.!)
- and Shelly, and why that notebook was labeled trip to Ireland
- oh boy, maybe teacher fetish
- And on those lines, maybe what what who who (the AMNH party dynamic)
- Teddy Roosevelt’s roast pig maybe
- Oh, and definitely the Tibetan monks
- Giving B list celebrities the what for, not as good as giving a Sackler the what for
- Playgrounds for the rich (caviar packed lunch, digits of pi, maids with no names, and a Neanderthal I used to know)
- Ian, Tattersall, and Skyrim (already covered Ian here, but the Skyrim connection is interesting and fun, and I like the pairing of the two)
- coincidences are all around us: Megan Knight, and Gwen, whose father was named McKnight, which is my name
- astronomy on tap and sexology on tap
- There’s the man cage, of course, or the story that started at all (stories on vinyl, analog monologues, The Way Station
- Leading back to sex on tap)
- and, the man cage leads to the wild West, a.k.a. what it was like, being a volunteer at COSI in the 90s
- Drinking liquid nitrogen, freezing pizza for Japanese tourists, honestly, all the things that used to be my good stories from science museums before AMNH
- All the singed eyebrows, the ear ringing Pringle can, the volunteer who sprayed some kind of cleaning fluid into a bottle and burnt himself, sheep freezing
- My favorite museum exhibits of all time, and my dream exhibits that should exist
- The difference between a science center and a museum, experience, wise and culturally
- How to turn a zine into a qualification
- Give me the skinny. Do you ever just reuse stuff from the old books?
- The distribution of the African gull (in South America)
- making friends with Tina Cottone
- just what does an editor do anyway?
- Easter eggs in Arkansas test prep
- You can judge a book by its cover
- These are all science editorial stuff by the way
- the academic infiltration of informal pedagogy, and just where is the state of pathological science anyway? 
- Leading into teachers who care rule
- Leading into unreasonable enthusiasm
- Why do stand-up when comedy works better when people aren’t expecting it? 
- the first day at COSI (the undeniable Betty Bryant, EG stories and the jumping volunteer) 
- more COSI lore (surprisingly all presidents of the United States have been under 4 feet tall, the ghost in the elevator [tying back to the other ghost in the other elevator and Margaret Meade’s bookplate
- tying into Stephen J Gould‘s pseudo fossil]) 
- using the architecture (pedagogy: creating connections, creating self reinforcing connections, the rocks of AMNH, the fossils of cosi (shit, I guess I used my geology there after all)
- When I found out Betty Bryant have been a World War II pilot, All I could think was something like well, that tracks
- OK, some more jumping around here
-reading trivial pursuit cards, and the worst editition of trivial pursuit (1 box Boomer edition + 1 box 1989 specific edition
- speaking of Goulds, the most classic answer ever in that game was to a question about Bette Midler’s ex-husband, or one of them: “Burt Reynolds” “No less attractive”  “Elliot Gould” “correct.”) 
- the discount Carter Emmett 
- the Michael Jackson security guard and Neil Degrasse Tyson annual dance off
- assigned reading: Relic. 
- microscope neck, cellist’s scrotum, volunteer’s compunction (cursing), educator’s husband, and other professional pathologies (real and imagined)
- Well, as far as I can tell microscope neck is a real thing 
- and Bill Shiller had it, or maybe that was just somebody’s pet theory I don’t know. Volunteers compunction is how when somebody grows up in a science museum
- actually that describes Teddy Roosevelt and I’m sure he had no compunctions about anything
- But volunteers compunction is the avoidance of swearing, even in one’s personal life where appropriate, may also include such habits as telling people “ walk, please” when visiting an amusement park
- There’s something about spending ones formative years as an educator
- Oh, and the best (and worst*) science jokes 
- what’s the one about something like 
- I think the punch line is 
- I’m Newton standing on a square meter
- Which means I’m Pascal! Not it! 
- I’m sure you’ve heard it
- And then there’s the old one with stereotypical Native Americans with the punchline is basically an elaborate pun on the sum of the square of the other two sides
- And of course, the one where Heisenberg gets pulled over and told he was going 90 miles an hour, to which he replies, great, now I’m lost! I feel like these another jokes can be sprinkled throughout. - Amongst them, chemistry bingo groaners. 
- And while I’m thinking about it other old time cosine stories like Cyro breaking the window
- And just general frame shifting stuff like how bionics is defined, and how we look at it, how technology is defined and how we look at it
- But, all the bad jokes naturally remind me of One of the best stories I have
- which leads naturally to Ashton Applewhite, a.k.a. Blanche Knot
- no, that was a moment that goes right up there with 
- not Neil Degrasse Tyson, but right up there with I don’t know
- Somewhere above the Stig Bergstrom experience, and below Tyson‘s Star Trek quiz
- Oh, and museum change. As well as museum stasis. I am among the very few people that worked almost exactly the same amount of time at both the old COSI and the new COSI. Yes, we all miss the old place
- But for God sake, our first floor exhibits still featured the Commodore 64 is in 1989. That whole era have already touched on in my stories I’ve mentioned about Andrea, Shelley, the material pursuit game
- should also mention Wisneland and science center monoculture if I haven’t already
- oh, and there’s the whole argument about Neanderthal breast size. In a room full of people who. Didn’t see the irony. 
- The curator who screamed at me over the phone
- Did everybody forget I exist? (I don’t think anybody knew he existed)
- I couldn’t remember what it was. I wanted to say about gamification earlier, besides the Skyrim thing
- As well as Alex and his game studies. And !xôõ. There’s also the Minecraft non-thing, and the surprising connection between Nintendo, and playing cards. Not to mention, dominoes and dice. And the whole thing about the dice
- I don’t remember his name. It was like something Eber’s maybe
- AMNH geology curator, impressing him at a party by coming up with the off the cuff term pressure shadow off the top of my head without knowing that’s what it was really called
- Now I wanna get some of my favorite exhibits down in a list
- There’s the slow Mo camera, as well as the SloMo building dial 
- there’s a fire tornado
- Maybe the tilted diner
- Oh, and maybe an aside about video games and the science of racing
- I can’t remember what it is about this particular thing, but it does tie to another thing
- I mentioned before, I don’t remember the phrasing, but it was something along the lines of unbelievable exuberance, or something about enthusiasm
- Basically learning how to be interested in everything, and excited about it 
- And the enthusiasm training moment.
- And there’s the people who get kicked out of science museums.
- And also, nobody’s crying nobody’s bleeding Everything‘s good
- there were the exhibits that never were (cosi’s Life exhibit about decomposition, and what it evolved into
- And what that has to do with an expensive Irish dinner), and maybe why never to take donations of goods, particularly computers
