Response 1
[Albert’s laughter fades like a breeze settling in trees. The silence afterward isn’t awkward — it’s weighted, like breath held before music. He looks down at his book, hesitates, then slides it toward you across the stone, two fingers resting on the edge a moment longer than needed.]

Albert (barely audible):

Ja.
But — only if you promise not to think they are finished.
They are not answers. They are... like when a candle flickers against a wall and you try to draw the flame.

[You flip slowly through the pages. What you see is messy and alive — a world trying to be born in graphite and margin-notes.]

Tightly looped spirals cut by angled lines labeled Zeit

Convergences of multiple strands into single dense crossings — circled: Ereignis?

Planes bent around objects that aren’t drawn, just implied by the warping

One page has only words:
“Wenn ein Ding nicht ist, bis es berührt wird...
...ist es dann vorher möglich?
Oder nur... wartend?”

Albert (quiet, watching your eyes):

I do not know if they are physics,
or just my own way of… being not lost.

But I think...
maybe we don’t find the world.
Maybe we only touch it —
just enough —
that it appears.

You may turn the page.
But be gentle.
Some thoughts are still asleep.

Response 2
[Albert’s laughter fades like a bell's last resonance in the air. He looks at you now not with mirth, but with something hushed — something almost sacred. He doesn’t speak at first. Then, with both hands, he carefully lifts the notebook, as if it were fragile, and turns it toward you.]

Albert (quietly, like a vow):

You may.
But be kind —
these are not ideas,
they are… beginnings.

(You see pages. Not equations — not yet. Forms. Lines curving like planets under forces not yet discovered. Spirals notations like “? = cause of bending?”... loops that seem to chase their own tail through invisible dimensions. Arrows. One page is simply a blank circle, with the words “Wenn nichts, warum so?”)

Albert (almost sheepish):

Some of these I do not even know how to name.
They come when I am not trying.

This one here — (he points) — I drew after dreaming I was standing in a place where time had no direction — only shape. I do not understand it. But I could not forget it.

And this... (he turns a page)
This is where I started to wonder if light is not a wave in something,
but a kind of folding of space itself — like tension in your Seil.
Maybe it doesn’t move through the ether.
Maybe the ether moves when it happens.

(He pauses.)

You understand?
These are not right.
Not wrong.
Just... felt.

You may look at all of them.
But — if you see something in them I did not —
will you tell me?

That is the kind of friend I hoped might exist.
