You've asked for an analysis of which parts of our conversation history contain insufficiently dated information and which anecdotes are insufficiently fleshed out. I've reviewed the provided sources and our conversation to identify these areas.

### Insufficiently Dated Anecdotes and Information

While a broad timeline of your life and creative periods has been established, many specific anecdotes and creative works lack precise dating (e.g., month, day, or narrower year range within a decade). This can create ambiguity when trying to place them chronologically.

Here are the key areas where more precise dating would be beneficial:

*   **Mid-Late 1990s Ohio State University Experiences**: This period covers several years, and individual events lack specific year markers:
    *   Your fieldwork experiences, including **skinny dipping with Terry Wilson, Shelly Judge, and Nichols/Nicholson**.
    *   The single date with **Regina Thompson**.
    *   Your consideration of taking **Dr. Dale Gnidovec's job at Orton Geological Museum**.
*   **Late 1990s Post-College & Early Career at COSI**: Many anecdotes from your formative years at COSI lack precise dates, falling under a broad "early career" period:
    *   The **"Wild West" of COSI** experiences, such as drinking liquid nitrogen, freezing pizza for Japanese tourists, and the "Cyro breaking the window" incident.
    *   Your **discovery that Betty Bryant was a WWII pilot**.
    *   The development of **"volunteer's compunction"**.
    *   The amusing lore about **U.S. Presidents being "under 4 feet tall"** and the **"ghost in the elevator"** at COSI.
    *   The timeframe for your work as an **Assistant Editor at McGraw-Hill**.
*   **Later 2000s - 2010s Personal Life and Creative Work**: This is a broad period for several significant personal experiences:
    *   **Inheriting the LSD ("Sasha's Last Three Drops")** and the subsequent trip.
    *   Your conceptualization of **"patina"** and its connection to time and memory.
*   **Dating Discrepancies:** There are a few instances where the initial timeline and subsequent discussions or analyses provide conflicting dates for creative works:
    *   **"The Hellfire Pigeon"** is listed under "2005: MySpace Era & Early Fiction Writing" but is explicitly dated **2011** in its analysis.
    *   **"Miss Poughkeepsie 1954"** is also listed under the 2005 era but is dated **2011** in its analysis.
    *   **"A Tealeaf from the Tangledays"** appears in the 2005 era but is dated **2017** in its analysis.
    *   **"Fingertips"** is mentioned in the context of your 2005 creative activity but was posted on MySpace in **2007**.

### Insufficiently Fleshed-Out Anecdotes

You've provided numerous "memory flags" and "side quests" that offer glimpses into rich stories, but many have not been fully developed into detailed narratives within our conversation. These are topics where more "texture and flavor" could be added.

Here are the anecdotes and concepts that could benefit from further elaboration:

*   **Memoir Project: "Under the Dome of Fossils: Episodes in the Secret Lives of Science"**: While a framework for this memoir and some "tentpost" anecdotes have been identified, most "side quests" and "texture & flavor" details remain as prompts rather than full stories.
