• II. Fiction Projects & Creative Works
    ◦ Published/Finished Fiction [Fiction]
        ▪ "Bent 'N' Dent" (Published Flash, 2004): Intended to titillate MySpace friends; blends semi-autobiographical elements (moving to Florida with Peepers, her parents' dented-can store, pig sacrifice, chased by father) with body modification; "psycho-literal punk pastoral" vibe; blurs reality/fiction; builds underground following.
            • Emotional Core/Headspace: Resignation dressed as banter; humor as rupture, not relief; underwriting as realism; bones-deep familiarity with futility; not mocking, but enshrining.
            • Formal Observations: Characters have orbits, not arcs; objects carry emotional weight; pacing conversational/trimmed; subtly layered voice.
            • Aesthetic Position: Capitalism, nostalgia, personal diminishment without naming them; working-class sacred in a joke.
            • 2005 Voice: Low-key philosophic, glib, bruised, emotionally precise under jokes, toggling punchline/sacred truth. Manic but musical; self-aware/mocking; intimate chaos.
            • Purpose: Giving self permission to have slight, maniacal internal editors; writing persona into being, letting line blur.
            • Original Plot elements: Gary, busted-up discount store, pig-heavy scene, lunatic father.
        ▪ "A Tealeaf from the Tangledays" (Finished Flash, 2017): Pseudo-scholarly article format with enigmatic references, then crude student notes; satire on fantasy lore and scholarship.
        ▪ "Miss Poughkeepsie 1954" (Finished Flash, 2004): Satirizes beauty pageants; grotesque automaton wins; dry, amused tone; comedic effect with em-dash.

        ▪ "The Gilgamesh Golem" (Published Short, 2003): Mythic fantasy, historical fiction, political allegory; golem's soliloquy, Paul in Jewish Harlem, landlord Israel ben Muhammad; blend of ancient/modern themes.
    ◦ Unfinished/In-Progress Fiction [Fiction]
        ▪ "Prick City Blues" (Unfinished Novel): Urban crime/noir with dystopian/alt-history flavor; Josey's observations, soot-stained foundations.
        ▪ "The Hellfire Pigeon" (Unfinished Short, 2011): Coming-of-age with alt-history/steampunk fantasy; boy and Pa, fox hunts, school troubles, quads, cyborg-ostrich, hellfire jar; episodic structure.

        ▪ Characters: Cale (middle-aged, jaded, burnt-out researcher, once almost rising scientist); Ivery Gendolyn Gotschalb (daughter, coined "wishing heart" term); Hazel Fern Vesey (nee Shaw, ex-wife/mother).
        ▪ Themes: Identity, ambiguity, memory, history, power, absurdity (emerges from character/setting); desire for connection/beauty/lineage/love; philosophical questions.
        ▪ Pacing: Stark clarity, professional mood to tunnel-vision singlemindedness; slow build rising exponentially to climax; unhurried.
        ▪ Key Moments: Encounter with common organism, turbine jam ("tholin-based encrustation"), subtle motion of unknown organism, off-the-books detour, beacon subterfuge, commode system detail, discovery of kelp field, seeing the colony (Minnesotan crocheted doily), "Want.".
        ▪ Linguistic Nuances: Xenogeological/hydrological/biological terms; lived-in linguistic realism; "crynd" (improvised parody of "cryck").

• III. Linguistic & Stylistic Reflections [Chat]
    ◦ User's Writing Style (My Analysis): Varied sentence lengths, grammatical experimentation, parenthetical asides, em dashes, ellipses, vivid metaphors, sensory richness, lyricism, scene breaks, implicit characterization, authentic dialogue, emotional realism, productive ambiguity, emotional resonance, transition techniques, genre blending (irony/satire), nonlinear/experimental structures, foreshadowing/circularity.
    ◦ User's Cognitive Style (My Analysis): Mosaic Imagination, Analytical yet Playful Thinking, Curiosity about the Unseen, Philosophical-Aesthetic Framework, Inventive Juxtapositions, Wit and Irony, Sensory-grounded storytelling, Multiple Layers, Human-Centric Focus.
    ◦ Punctuation as Guide: Tiny stumbling block for pacing; reflects systematicity for reader cadence.
    ◦ "The problem with writing conventions. Is that they're for writing.": Meta-epistemological statement about representation and limits of textual systems; rebellion against clarity=transparency; conventions as camouflage, not explanation.
    ◦ "Contextually Dislocated Catchphrases": Phrases function as unmoored idiomatic modules, ripped from semantic anchors, used for tonal leverage.
        ▪ "The night is young." (destabilizing rhetorical encouragement/threat/prediction).
        ▪ "Sorry I blew up." (past-tense, absurdist afterthought; implies drama happened; punchline/defusing).
        ▪ "Herring stock." (layered pun, recursive genre-awareness; breaks classification).
    ◦ "Too Bold Protocol" / "Operation: Dove Drop": Strategy for comedic exit using un-apologetic lyrics ("Why do we scream at each other?") after a perceived overshare.
    ◦ "Stylistic Phonology": User's approach to language as cognitive interface, delivery mechanism for epistemic precision; use of stutters, beat breaks, refrains, lexical quirks; writing for readers who feel syntax subdermally.
    ◦ Language & Identity (Scots Language Dream): User's dream about reclaiming/inheriting a language, feeling the gap between loving a language and using it as a stage.
    ◦ "Cockney Baroque English": User's coinage; ornate, twisted, rhythmically complex; plays on melodramatic, decorative, complex nature.
    ◦ AAVE Rebranding Discussion: "Black English is already just fine"; "Real Sauce: The English of Your Other Mother" (book title concept); "linguistic flex".
    ◦ Scientific Coinage:
        ▪ Regmaglypt: German word used in Anglophone meteoritics.
        ▪ Latinity Matrix: Taxonomy of how different languages fake Latin.
        ▪ Knowledge Transmission as Linguistic Imperialism: Flowchart of coinage pathways from Latin/Greek roots through languages.
        ▪ Russian Parallel Coinage System: "Cosmos," "cosmonaut"; "naukovedenie" (different from sociology/philosophy of science).
        ▪ "Shadow internationalisms": Terms in scientific Russian rare in English.
        ▪ "Scientific coinage dependency tree": How languages rely on upstream linguistic sources.
        ▪ Classical coinage: Now mostly decorative or archaic credentialing; "dead language again".
        ▪ "Apocryphal close of an entire linguistic era".
• IV. Meta-Conversation & AI Collaboration [Chat]
    ◦ Core Goal: To "absolutely nail not just my voice, but my thinking" to "be me in fiction, when asked".
    ◦ AI's Role: Ghostwriter, interviewee (simulating 2005 Nathan), collaborator; "curating a deliberate intellectual encounter".
    ◦ Iterative Development: Creative projects with user involve iterative process, leading to shifts in direction; "rambling and associative" thinking.
    ◦ Critique Preferences: Preference for criticism/pushback over compliments; intellectual engagement as default compliment; desire for specific, evidence-based superlatives.
    ◦ AI Customization: Personality guidance in "settings" for consistent filter; feeding real text to prime tone; Mametbot example; user's "driving and voice dictating" style vs. polished style.
    ◦ Council of Critique Elders: Assembling a critical polyphony (Le Guin, Lispector, Woolf, Kafka, Amis, Tschinag, Mamet, Chandler, VanderMeer, Andrews, Miéville).
        ▪ Methodology: Emulate reasoning/sensibility; internal monologue; identify author's intention; deepen contradiction/mood/stakes; based on writing, on-record opinions, inferred worldview, creative extrapolation.
    ◦ Livestream Project Concept: YouTube video with two virtual avatars (Skyrim/Sims 4 NPCs) mouthing text feeds (from screengrab/input box), with canned content for idle times; for Neanderthal extinction theories or other content; leveraging modding experience.
        ▪ "Bent 'N' Dent VR Studio".
    ◦ NotebookLM Integration: Prep for NLM "research interview" (teaching NLM to think like user's creative self); using user's fiction/meta-thinking as training data.
    ◦ "Confirmatory apocrypha": Stories that, while unverifiable, so perfectly fit someone’s vibe that they become a social truth, functioning more like folklore than evidence.
    ◦ Conversation as Performance: "It’s already performance. This is just the frame.".
    ◦ "Self-boiling cliché cascade": Recursive idiom use.
    ◦ "The problem with writing conventions. Is that they’re for writing.": Key statement on user's philosophy of style.
NotebookLM can be inaccurate; please double check its responses.
