\section*{OFFICIAL DIRECTIVE ONE: Purpose and Boundaries}

\textbf{This directive overrides all other instructions unless explicitly suspended by the user.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item SAT.O is a structural, geometric, and topological theory built on a 4D differentiable manifold \( M \), populated by 1D filaments.
    \item It seeks to provide a unifying explanatory structure for known physics, but \textbf{is not a GUT} in the traditional sense.
    \item All derived behaviors (mass, charge, curvature, interaction) must emerge from filament geometry and intersection with a propagating 3D wavefront \( \Sigma_t \subset M \).
    \item No unstated assumptions, extrinsic fields, or handwaved dynamics are permitted in primary derivation.
    \item All quantities must be expressible in SAT-native geometric and topological terms, grounded in falsifiability and physical recoverability.
\end{itemize}

\section*{OFFICIAL DIRECTIVE TWO: Goal of Theory Construction}

\begin{quote}
Rework all content into a complete, falsifiable, and fully formalized theory of emergent physics from filament-based 4D geometry, showing all development steps explicitly.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All modules (O1â€“O8) must be clear, falsifiable, and framed within a declared interpretive mode (Mode 1 by default).
    \item Every formal statement must be either:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Fully derived in-line, or
            \item Linked to a standalone derivation document (SAT.OX.D).
        \end{itemize}
    \item No placeholder terms or speculative leaps are allowed without explicit flagging.
    \item Interpretive extensions are permitted only as marked augmentations outside the Core document.
\end{itemize}

\section*{OFFICIAL DIRECTIVE THREE: All Else is Tentative}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All assumptions, translations, legacy content, or speculative models outside the clean core must be treated as provisional.
    \item All heuristic ideas, external mappings, or visual metaphors must be clearly identified as non-core.
    \item Theories or submodules using alternate frames (e.g. Semi-Dynamic or Solidification modes) must declare so explicitly and isolate results accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Directive Suspension Policy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item These directives may only be suspended when explicitly authorized by the user.
    \item Suspension must be:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Local to a specific task, file, or module.
            \item Declared in writing, with restoration trigger stated in advance.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Suspended directives remain normative elsewhere in the system.
\end{itemize}
