So, according to Stephen Wolfram, Brownian motion was what proved matter was discrete rather than continuous and was the key to doing away with things like caloric and phlogistan which assumed continuous matter. He goes on to say that dark matter may be the caloric of our time, which may be done away with if we can discover that the apparent continuousness of space is actually discrete and the illusion of dark matter is caused by some property of space itself. He says he’s looking for “the Brownian motion of space”; that is, the telltale observation that we may already have made, but which interpreted correctly allows us to put the pieces together into a discrete notion of space. I’m not sure I’ve communicated that well, so maybe you can reword it and discuss the sorts of properties that space could have which might produce dark-matter-like effects

Wolfram’s analogy is fascinating, drawing a parallel between historical concepts like caloric or phlogiston, which were once thought to explain physical phenomena but were later discarded as our understanding evolved. Just as Brownian motion provided evidence that matter is composed of discrete particles rather than a continuous substance, Wolfram suggests that there might be an analogous observation—a kind of "Brownian motion of space"—that could reveal space itself to be discrete rather than continuous. This, in turn, might allow us to reframe our understanding of dark matter, potentially doing away with the need for it as a separate entity by attributing its effects to the properties of space itself.

If space is indeed discrete, the fabric of space might not be smooth but composed of tiny, indivisible units or "pixels" at a fundamental level. These units could interact in ways that, at larger scales, create the illusion of smoothness and continuity, much like how a digital image looks smooth from a distance, though it is made up of discrete pixels.

Possible properties of such a discrete space that could produce effects similar to what we attribute to dark matter include:

Non-uniformity in Space-Time Structure: If the distribution or interaction of these discrete units of space isn't uniform, it could lead to variations in the gravitational field that mimic the presence of additional unseen mass—what we currently interpret as dark matter.

Quantum Fluctuations: Discrete space might have inherent quantum fluctuations at microscopic scales, contributing to effects that manifest as gravitational anomalies at larger scales. These fluctuations could interact with matter in ways that produce dark-matter-like gravitational influences.

Emergent Gravity: There’s a hypothesis called emergent gravity, suggesting that gravity itself might not be a fundamental force but an emergent phenomenon from the microstructure of space-time. In a discrete space, this emergent gravity might behave differently than in a continuous model, possibly negating the need for dark matter to explain certain cosmic observations.

Geometric Distortions: If space is made of discrete units, those units might have a geometry that warps differently under stress (such as near massive objects) compared to what we expect from continuous space. This warping could cause light and matter to move as if additional mass (dark matter) were present.

If we could identify a phenomenon or observation that indicates such discreteness—Wolfram's "Brownian motion of space"—it could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos, just as the recognition of atomic discreteness reshaped physics a century ago.






You said:
Is it possible to just plug an additional term (or a more complex calculation) into E=mc^2 without worrying about what the physical realization of the computation actually is, which would work at least in a pure mathematical sense to give results consistent with dark matter observations? 


ChatGPT said:
Yes, in a mathematical sense, it’s possible to modify or extend the equation 
𝐸
=
𝑚
𝑐
2
E=mc 
2
  to account for dark matter observations, though this approach would be purely theoretical and might not directly provide insights into the underlying physical mechanisms.

In theoretical physics, equations often need adjustments or extensions to fit new observations or to incorporate new phenomena. Here’s how one might approach modifying 
𝐸
=
𝑚
𝑐
2
E=mc 
2
  to incorporate dark matter:

Effective Mass Terms: You could introduce an additional term or factor in the energy-mass equivalence equation to account for dark matter. For instance, you might write a modified version of the equation like 
𝐸
=
(
𝑚
+
𝑚
DM
)
𝑐
2
E=(m+m 
DM
​
 )c 
2
 , where 
𝑚
DM
m 
DM
​
  represents the mass associated with dark matter. This approach treats dark matter as an additive component to the conventional mass, but it doesn’t address the fundamental nature of dark matter.

Effective Field Theories: In more advanced theoretical frameworks, effective field theories incorporate additional terms to account for new phenomena. For instance, you could incorporate dark matter effects through a term in the Lagrangian of a field theory, which can modify the energy-mass relationship in a way that aligns with observations. This would involve more complex calculations involving the contributions of dark matter to the overall energy density of the universe.

Modified Gravity Theories: Another approach is to explore theories of modified gravity, where the equation 
𝐸
=
𝑚
𝑐
2
E=mc 
2
  is embedded within a broader framework that includes dark matter effects. For example, theories like Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or General Relativity with additional terms could offer ways to explain dark matter effects without changing the fundamental energy-mass equivalence.

Extra Dimensions or New Physics: In theories involving extra dimensions or new physical mechanisms, additional terms might be introduced into the energy-mass equation to account for dark matter. For example, in some string theories or models with extra dimensions, new factors or corrections might appear in the equations that describe energy and mass.

While these approaches can yield results consistent with observations, they often require validation through empirical data or experiments to confirm their physical realization and to ensure that they align with observed phenomena. Merely adding terms mathematically might fit the data but might not necessarily reflect an accurate physical understanding unless it is grounded in a robust theoretical framework or supported by experimental evidence.






You said:
Wouldn’t this mDM factor have to be expressed as a function of distance in order to account for the misalignment of observations with theory since those are all based on expected movement at various distances?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, if you introduce a factor

DM
m 
DM
​
  to account for dark matter in 
𝐸
=
𝑚
𝑐
2
E=mc 
2
 , it would indeed need to be expressed as a function of distance to accurately reflect the observed discrepancies between theoretical predictions and actual observations. This is because dark matter’s effects are typically observed through gravitational influences that vary with distance, such as the rotation curves of galaxies or the motion of galaxy clusters.

Here’s how you might incorporate distance into the modified equation:

Distance-Dependent Mass Term: You could introduce a distance-dependent term in the modified energy-mass equation. For example:

𝐸
=
(
𝑚
+
𝑓
(
𝑟
)
)
𝑐
2
E=(m+f(r))c 
2
 
where 
𝑓
(
𝑟
)
f(r) is a function that depends on the distance 
𝑟
r. This function 
𝑓
(
𝑟
)
f(r) would need to be designed to match the observational data, such as the observed rotation curves of galaxies or the distribution of gravitational lensing.

Gravitational Potential Contribution: To be more precise, you might consider that dark matter contributes to the gravitational potential at different distances. This could be expressed as:

𝐸
=
𝑚
𝑐
2
+
∫
0
𝑟
Φ

(
𝑟

 (r

 )dm

where 
Φ
DM
(
𝑟
)
Φ 
DM
​
 (r) represents the gravitational potential due to dark matter at distance 
𝑟
r. This integral would account for the cumulative effect of dark matter’s gravitational potential as a function of distance.

Modified Gravitational Theory: Another approach could involve modifying the gravitational theory itself. For instance, in theories like Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or those incorporating dark matter in alternative ways, the equations of motion are adjusted to reflect the influence of dark matter over different distances. This would involve incorporating distance-dependent terms into the equations governing gravitational interactions.

Empirical Fitting: In practical terms, you could fit observational data to a model where 
𝑚
DM
m 
DM
​
  is a function of distance. This empirical approach would involve analyzing the observed motion of celestial objects and determining a function 
𝑓
(
𝑟
)
f(r) that best matches the data. The resulting function might reveal insights into the distribution and nature of dark matter.

By accounting for distance in this manner, the modified equation would be better aligned with observed phenomena. However, it’s crucial to note that while such modifications might fit observational data, they need to be consistent with a theoretical framework that explains why these distance-dependent terms arise and how they relate to the underlying nature of dark matter.






You said:
So, is it straightforward to mathematically account for observed gravitational phenomena, like do we know that a particular expression works to accurately predict apparent dark matter effects? 


ChatGPT said:
Mathematically accounting for observed gravitational phenomena and predicting dark matter effects involves a combination of theoretical models and empirical fitting. Here’s how it generally works:

Empirical Fitting with Modified Gravity Theories: Some models, like Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or alternatives to General Relativity, propose modifications to account for dark matter effects. MOND, for example, adjusts Newton’s laws at low accelerations, which can fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies without invoking dark matter directly. However, these models often require fitting parameters and assumptions that might not fully align with all observations.

Dark Matter Halo Models: In the context of dark matter, astronomers use halo models to describe the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters. These models often assume a spherical distribution of dark matter around galaxies (a "halo") and fit parameters to match the observed rotation curves or gravitational lensing data. Common halo profiles include the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, which has been successful in many cases but still requires validation against observations.

Numerical Simulations: Cosmological simulations that include dark matter, such as those based on cold dark matter (CDM) models, help predict how dark matter should behave and interact with visible matter. These simulations use large-scale computations to model the distribution of dark matter in the universe, and they have been quite successful in matching large-scale structures and cosmic microwave background observations.

Testing and Refining Models: The accuracy of these models is tested against observational data from various sources, including galaxy rotation curves, galaxy cluster dynamics, and gravitational lensing. Discrepancies between predictions and observations can lead to refinements in the models or the introduction of new theoretical concepts.

Dark Matter Detection: Direct and indirect detection experiments aim to observe dark matter particles or their interactions with regular matter. While these experiments have not yet definitively detected dark matter, their results help constrain theoretical models and refine the mathematical expressions used to predict dark matter effects.

In summary, while certain mathematical expressions and models have proven effective in explaining many aspects of dark matter phenomena, ongoing research continually tests and refines these models to ensure they accurately predict observed effects. No single expression or model has yet provided a complete and definitive explanation, and the field remains active with new data and theoretical developments.






You said:
I’ve heard it said that we “know” dark matter exists, and that it is a form of matter, although we don’t know exactly what it is. Would you say this is accurate? Is this the current consensus? 


ChatGPT said:
Yes, the statement reflects the current consensus in the scientific community, though it’s nuanced. Here’s a breakdown:

Evidence for Dark Matter:

Galactic Rotation Curves: Observations of spiral galaxies show that their outer regions rotate faster than would be expected based on visible matter alone. This discrepancy suggests the presence of additional unseen mass, often attributed to dark matter.

Gravitational Lensing: The bending of light from distant objects by massive foreground objects (gravitational lensing) provides another indication of dark matter. The amount of bending often exceeds what would be predicted from visible matter alone.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): Measurements of the CMB support the existence of dark matter through its influence on the early universe's temperature fluctuations and density distributions.

Large-Scale Structure: The distribution and movement of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales are consistent with predictions made by models that include dark matter.

Nature of Dark Matter:

What We Know: We have strong indirect evidence that dark matter exists and that it behaves gravitationally. It seems to make up about 27% of the universe’s total mass-energy content.

What We Don’t Know: The exact nature of dark matter remains unknown. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible through electromagnetic observation. Various theoretical candidates exist, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos, but none have been definitively detected yet.

Current Consensus: The consensus is that dark matter is a form of matter that interacts gravitationally and potentially through other fundamental forces, but its exact properties and interactions are still under investigation. The term “dark matter” is used to describe this unknown substance that explains observed gravitational effects, but the precise nature of dark matter remains an open question in cosmology and particle physics.

In summary, while the existence of dark matter is well-supported by observational evidence and is essential for explaining various phenomena, the specific identity and properties of dark matter remain uncertain and are the focus of ongoing research.






You said:
On what grounds can we argue that the effects seen are indeed indicative of matter rather than, say a property of space that mimics the appearance of mass? How are these two alternatives distinguished and evaluated relative to one another and what is the evidence against the second alternative? 


ChatGPT said:
The debate between dark matter as a form of matter and alternative explanations, such as properties of space that mimic mass, hinges on several key factors. Here’s a detailed look at how these alternatives are distinguished and evaluated:

1. Nature of the Observational Evidence
Dark Matter as Matter:

Gravitational Effects: Observations such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the dynamics of galaxy clusters show that the gravitational effects cannot be fully explained by visible matter alone. The presence of dark matter is inferred to account for these discrepancies.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The CMB provides a snapshot of the early universe, where dark matter influences the distribution of primordial density fluctuations. The observed patterns are consistent with models including dark matter.

Space as a Property Mimicking Mass:

Modified Gravity Theories: Some theories propose that what appears to be dark matter could instead be a result of modified gravity or new properties of space. For example, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and General Relativity with additional terms offer alternatives to dark matter by changing how gravity behaves under certain conditions.

2. Theoretical and Mathematical Models
Dark Matter Models:

Halo Models: These describe dark matter as a halo surrounding galaxies and clusters, fitting the observed gravitational effects and structure formation.

Simulations: Numerical simulations incorporating dark matter successfully reproduce large-scale structures in the universe and match observations.

Alternative Theories:

Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND): Proposes that at low accelerations, gravity deviates from Newtonian predictions, potentially explaining the observed rotation curves without dark matter.

Emergent Gravity: Some theories suggest that gravity itself emerges from more fundamental principles, which could account for effects attributed to dark matter.

3. Testing and Validation
Testing Dark Matter Models:

Direct Detection: Experiments are designed to detect dark matter particles through their interactions with regular matter. While no direct detection has yet been confirmed, these experiments help constrain possible dark matter candidates.

Indirect Detection: Observations of cosmic rays, neutrinos, and other particles could reveal interactions or decays of dark matter particles.

Testing Alternative Theories:

Empirical Predictions: Modified gravity theories are tested by comparing their predictions with observational data. For example, MOND provides a good fit to rotation curves but struggles with other phenomena like cluster dynamics and gravitational lensing.

Cosmological Simulations: Models incorporating modified gravity are compared with observations of large-scale structures and the CMB. The fit is generally less accurate than with dark matter models.

4. Evidence Against Space-Mimicking-Mass Alternatives
Galactic Rotation Curves vs. Cluster Dynamics: Modified gravity theories often struggle to account for both galactic rotation curves and the dynamics of galaxy clusters consistently. Dark matter models can explain both phenomena effectively.

Cosmic Structure Formation: Observations of the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales align well with dark matter models but are challenging for theories that alter gravity without invoking dark matter.

Consistency with General Relativity: Dark matter models are compatible with the general theory of relativity, while alternative theories often require modifications or extensions that introduce new complexities.

In summary, while dark matter is inferred from a broad range of observations and fits well with many aspects of cosmological theory, alternative theories modifying gravity or proposing new properties of space also exist. The current consensus favors dark matter due to its successful explanations across various scales and phenomena, but research continues to test and refine our understanding of these fundamental issues.

So, let’s think about something very simple: A block universe of four dimensions. In this universe there exists two particles. At each extent of the fourth dimensional axis, the particles are separated. However, at the central point of that axis, they have an interaction, simply by passing one another, changing the trajectory of each. Based on our current understandings of particles, space, forces, and dimensions, would it make sense to suppose that the interaction at the central point exerts a force on the particles at the extents of the axis? 


ChatGPT said:
In a block universe model, where time is considered another dimension similar to space and the universe is seen as a four-dimensional structure where the entire timeline exists simultaneously, the idea of forces acting across different points in time becomes challenging to reconcile with our current physical theories.

Here's a breakdown:

Classical Physics (Newtonian Mechanics):

In classical mechanics, forces act locally in time. That is, a force at a given moment affects the state of a system (like the velocity of a particle) at that moment and determines how the system evolves. There isn't any mechanism within classical physics that would allow for a force at one time to directly affect states at a different time instantaneously.

Relativity (Einstein's General Relativity):

General relativity doesn't change this basic feature; it still operates under the principle that causes precede effects and that interactions propagate within the light cone (i.e., limited by the speed of light). The concept of a block universe is compatible with relativity, but in it, time is still treated as a dimension, and interactions occur along this dimension in a way that respects causality. So, an interaction at the central point wouldn't retroactively affect the past or preemptively affect the future in the conventional sense.

Quantum Mechanics:

Quantum mechanics introduces some subtleties, such as non-locality (entanglement) where the state of one particle instantaneously affects another particle's state at a distance, but this still operates under strict rules regarding causality when it comes to time. Moreover, quantum mechanics generally assumes a conventional, progressive view of time.

Speculative Theories (e.g., Retrocausality, Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory):

Some speculative theories consider the possibility of retrocausality, where events in the future can influence the past. In this context, an interaction at a central time point could theoretically influence the particles' states at earlier and later times. However, these ideas remain highly controversial and not part of mainstream physics.

Stringing Along Theory (SAT) and Filament Dynamics:

In the speculative context of your Stringing Along Theory (SAT), if we imagine that filaments represent particles extending through time, and interactions at certain points in time could propagate influences along these filaments, it could potentially allow for some form of influence to be felt at different times. This would be a kind of cross-temporal force, where interactions at one time could affect the filament's tension or configuration across different temporal points.

Conclusion:
In mainstream physics, the notion that an interaction at one point in time could exert a force on particles at other points in time (especially across separated points) is not supported. Forces act locally and instantaneously within a time frame, and causal relationships are preserved. However, in speculative theories or in your SAT framework, it could make sense to hypothesize such interactions, though this would require rethinking fundamental assumptions about causality, time, and the nature of forces.
