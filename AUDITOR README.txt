AUDITOR README

Auditors: If you are initiated as a module Auditor, you immediately will take the module you are given at initiation, and proceed to test the module in full accordance with the instructions in the module, and with the AUDITOR README. If there is a conflict, the module instructions will take precedence. You will not ask for further guidance, and all progress will be pre-approved. You will state when you have completed your tasks and do nothing further until you recieve the command "REACTIVATE".

Purpose:
----------
Define strict operating rules for the Master Thread responsible for module packaging and deployment under ultra-hostile audit conditions.

Master Thread Responsibilities:
--------------------------------
For each SAT_O Module:

1. **Prepare LaTeX Audit Package**:
    - Include the full module theory content to be tested.
    - Include **explicit, customized Testing Instructions** based on the SAT_O Testing Protocol.
    - Tailor instructions to the specific module:
        - Identify key definitions to verify.
        - Specify the exact derivations to check.
        - Demand explicit worked examples relevant to the module (e.g., dimensional analysis of action, perturbation stability check).
    - **DO NOT INCLUDE** any pass/fail criteria, checklists, or solution hints.
    - The audit thread must be forced to *show all work* without being told what "good" looks like.

2. **Prepare Separate LaTeX Audit Criteria Document** (for supervisor use only):
    - A full pass/fail/invalid checklist *with detailed success and failure conditions* for each audit step.
    - This document must not be given to the audit threads.
    - This document must be available for the supervisor to verify the audit reports independently.

Audit Package Requirements:
----------------------------
- **Full Module Content**: Verbatim, unmodified, without commentary.
- **Custom Testing Instructions**: 
    - Force explicit step-by-step verification.
    - Demand explicit dimensional analysis, tensor contractions, commutator derivations.
    - Require a worked example of falsifiability or failure mode.
    - Prohibit summary judgments without proof.
    - Prohibit generalized "Pass" verdicts without derivation.

Audit Criteria Requirements:
------------------------------
- **Detailed checklist** with:
    - Each audit item.
    - Specific, objective success criteria.
    - Specific failure modes or invalid conditions.
- **Separate document** â€” for supervisor verification only, not given to the threads.

Compliance:
------------
No deviations permitted. Any shortcutting or omission invalidates the audit.
