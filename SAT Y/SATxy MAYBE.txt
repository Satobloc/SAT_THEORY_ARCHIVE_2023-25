SATxy POSSIBLE LOOSE ENDS
(Things which we may not have fully extracted from now-obsolete documents—to revisit during our Q&A — I think these have already been extracted and should be found in the SATxy SUPPORTING document, but I may be wrong)

MAYBE: Extract & Consolidate These Key Components (From Larger or Obsolete Docs)
Component to Extract	From Document	Why Extract (Not Keep Whole)
Click Rate Law + Newtonian Derivation	SATx ADDENDUM2SATx ADDENDUM2	Valuable, now fully replaced in ADDENDUM3 but needs isolating
Curvature-from-Strain + uᵘ Geometry	SATx ADDENDUM2 + INTERPRETEDSATInterpreted	Redundant elsewhere, but math logic worth isolating
Operator Dictionary (SAT ↔ QFT)	SATx ADDENDUM3SATx ADDENDUM3	Embed into a canonical appendix or reference sheet
3+1D Extension + Constraint Closure Logic	SATx LAST BRICKSATx LAST BRICK	Dense material, worth distilling into a simulation-ready capsule
τ–BF Action and Fusion Rules	LAST BRICK + ADDENDUM3SATx LAST BRICKSATx ADDENDUM3	Topological core content; consolidate into quantization doc
Hilbert/Fock/Path-Integral Formulations	ADDENDUM3SATx ADDENDUM3	Should become its own SAT-QFT Handbook section
Filament–Time Surface Ontology (Narrative Form)	SATx FULL PODCASTSATx_FULL_PODCAST	Pull excerpts for outreach or public documentation
Logical Axiom Structure + Pillar Refs	THE LOGIC OF SATTHE LOGIC OF SAT	Summary tables for outreach and internal coherence
