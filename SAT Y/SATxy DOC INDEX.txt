Core Documents to Carry Forward (With Index)
These documents are structurally vital, rich in mature content, and should be preserved in their entirety, with light copyediting only.
Essential Documents
A. SATx CANONICAL.txt
	•	Purpose: Defines SAT-X modular ontology in formalized, test-trackable form
	•	Contents: uᵘ, θ₄, ψ, τ modules; Hamiltonian dynamics; click laws; emergent curvature
	•	Status: Fully mature and modular
B. THE FUNDAMENTAL INTUITIONS OF SAT.txt
	•	Purpose: Philosophical grounding, intuitive metaphors, logic of unification
	•	Contents: Pillars, Propositions A–F, filament-time ontology, backreaction, causality
	•	Status: Complete and fully aligned with CANONICAL
C. SATx ADDENDUM3.txt
	•	Purpose: Most comprehensive operational theory doc
	•	Contents: Operator algebra, Fock space, path integrals, τ fusion logic, QFT bridge
	•	Status: Contains current working definitions for quantization and field mapping
D. SATx SPACKLECOAT.txt
	•	Purpose: Master prioritization and component ranking reference
	•	Contents: Component map (by necessity and outreach value); crosswalk to all sources
	•	Status: Fully distilled and irreplaceable for project planning
E. SATInterpreted.txt
	•	Purpose: Complete reinterpretation of GR within SAT terms
	•	Contents: Equivalence principle, effective curvature, foliation ontology
	•	Status: Clear standalone logic—retain as a public-friendly “GR-through-SAT” map

To Be Added to Workbook
F. SATX-Y PRELIM TASKS (user-created)
	•	Purpose: Early task list; internal buildout agenda
	•	Contents: Tiered build priorities: Ontology, Dynamics, SM/QFT embedding
	•	Status: Will form backbone of ongoing development plan
G. SATX-Y INDEX (new, to be created by user or with help)
	•	Purpose: Table of contents + cross-references across carried-forward documents
	•	Contents: Task map, module index, source anchors for every major claim or derivation
