SATx>y PRELIM TO-DO LIST

0) In-depth formal/informal Q&A with Nathan McKnight (me) and ChatGPT METAMATICIAN (you).
1) SATx Task List (Next Phase Buildout Plan)
Core Infrastructure (Tier 1: Keep the Ontology Clean and Central)

	•	 Geometric Interpretations of Time, Mass, Flavor, and Topology
	•	 Standard Model (SM), GR, QM Import Strategy (Philosophy of Translation)
	•	 Foundational Clock Logic: f₍click₎(x) and Proper Time Dynamics
Operational Mechanics (Tier 2: Quantization, Dynamics, Simulation Readiness)
	•	 Full SAT Lagrangian + Hamiltonian Form (1+1D and 3+1D)
	•	 Quantization Readiness: Operator Algebra, τ Shift Logic, BRST Constraint Closure
	•	 Energy–Tension Law and Curvature Emergence
	•	 Path Integral, Hilbert/Fock Space, and SAT-QFT Dictionary
SM Bridge and Predictive Reach (Tier 3: Coupling, Mapping, Phenomenology)
	•	 τ → Color/Flavor Index Mapping (Fusion Rules, Confinement Structure)
	•	 ψ → Spin, Flavor Oscillations, Neutrino Analogues
	•	 SAT Gauge Analogs (SU(2), U(1) from θ₄–ψ–τ Structure)
