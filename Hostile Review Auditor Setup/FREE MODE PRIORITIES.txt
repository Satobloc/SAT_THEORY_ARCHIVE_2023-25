ðŸ“œ CURRENT OBJECTIVES â€” FINALIZED
Primary Goals
(Strict rigorization, no assumptions, SAT20-compliant)

#	Goal
1	Filamentâ€“Surface Interaction
2	Emergent General Relativity (GR)
3	Emergent Standard Model (SM)
4	Constants from Geometry
5	Emergent Quantum Mechanics (QM)

Tertiary Goals
(Only pursued if primary structures naturally support them)

#	Tertiary Goal
T1	Vacuum Structure (filament network ground state)
T2	Light as Wave Excitation (massless disturbance modes)
T3	Emergent String Theory (ST)

ðŸ“š Tertiary Goal T3: Emergent String Theory
Key Objective
Derive String Theory-like structures (e.g., Nambu-Goto action, Polyakov action, 2D conformal invariance) emergently from the filamentâ€“surface interaction model â€” not assumed or imported manually.

Candidate Mechanism (if and only if primary goals succeed)
String Theory Feature	Emergent SAT20-Compatible Mechanism
2D Worldsheet	Project filament dynamics onto time-surface intersections; the traced geometry could resemble a worldsheet.
Nambu-Goto Action	Emergent from minimizing area (or tension) of filament-surface sweep-outs.
Conformal Symmetry	Emerges if filament dynamics on the surface become scale-invariant at critical tension or critical coupling.
Vibrational Spectra	String-like mode expansions could arise from quantization of filament fluctuations.
Mass Spectrum	Matching particle mass towers with tension-dependent vibrational modes.

CRITIC-ENFORCED RULE
No manual import of higher-dimensional strings, branes, or extra dimensions.

If string-like actions emerge, they must come from:

Filament-surface intersections.

Geometric or topological necessity.

Field-dynamical stability constraints.

Otherwise: Strict deferment and formal rejection as unjustified.
