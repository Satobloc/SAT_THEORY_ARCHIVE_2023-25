SAT 20: Principles of Minimal Assumption
The Scalar–Angular–Twist (SAT) 20 framework operates under a strict set of rules regarding allowed assumptions, prioritizing minimalism, necessity, and explicit justification to ensure its critic-hardened nature [1-6].
Here's a breakdown of what assumptions are allowed and under what conditions:
1.
Minimal Initial AssumptionsThe project begins with the absolute fewest possible assumptions:
◦
A 4D differentiable manifold M [2, 5, 7, 8].
◦
A single particle worldline (γ: R → M) parameterized by an affine parameter (λ) and its velocity vector (v^μ = dx^μ/dλ) [2, 5, 7].
◦
No metric, no connection, and no gauge fields are assumed initially [2, 5, 7, 8].
2.
Necessity-Driven Introduction of StructuresNew mathematical or geometric structures are only introduced when logically required to model observed or desired physical phenomena [1-8]. This means:
◦
Structures like connections, metrics, or gauge fields are not postulated from the outset but emerge [7, 9-12].
◦
Each new structure must be explicitly justified by a physical necessity, such as accounting for motion, mass, charge, or spin [2, 3, 5, 13].
◦
The framework strictly adheres to a "No A Priori Metric" principle, meaning that geometric structures are introduced only when forced by the behavior of the particle or its interactions, preventing circular dependencies and promoting genuine emergence [7, 8, 12, 14].
3.
Characteristics of Allowed AssumptionsAny assumption or new structure introduced must satisfy rigorous criteria enforced by "Critic Mode" [13, 15-17]:
◦
Minimality: Assumptions must be the absolute minimum necessary to explain the physical behavior [1, 13, 15, 17-19].
◦
Explicitness: All assumptions must be clearly stated and documented, leaving no hidden or implicit premises [13, 15, 17].
◦
Logical Necessity: Each addition must be unavoidable and logically compelled by the physical requirements [13, 15, 17, 18, 20].
◦
Consistency: New structures and emergent symmetries must be internally consistent with the existing framework [18, 21].
◦
Falsifiability: At every stage, the introduction of a structure must be accompanied by identified falsifiability criteria, outlining how the model could be empirically or logically disproven [1, 16, 20, 22-26].
4.
What is Explicitly NOT AllowedSeveral types of assumptions are explicitly forbidden within SAT 20 to maintain its core principles:
◦
No Hidden Tunable Parameters: This is a core tenet [4, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 21, 23, 27-48]. All coefficients and constants (e.g., c, ħ, e, α, G, me) must be geometrically or topologically determined by the fields themselves and their vacuum structures, not inserted manually or tuned ad hoc [4, 9, 10, 17-19, 23, 27, 35, 39, 40, 47-52].
◦
No A Priori Metric or Connection: These are not foundational postulates but must emerge from the field dynamics [2, 5, 7, 8, 12].
◦
No Implicit Geometry: All ambient manifolds, submanifolds, and coordinate charts must be explicitly defined as needed, avoiding ambiguity [53, 54].
◦
No Premature Commitment to Specific Models: If multiple minimal structures can model a physical property (e.g., helical geometries for particle properties), the project should delay commitment and explore alternatives until consistency or subsequent requirements force a choice [1-4, 13, 17, 20, 55-60].
◦
No Metaphysical Overclaims: The theory avoids making metaphysical commitments (e.g., about "objective now," causality) unless strictly forced by the mathematical formalism [24, 61-63].
5.
Iterative and Rigorous ControlThe process of introducing assumptions is continuously monitored through:
◦
Session Start Routine: Confirming "Memory OFF" and recapping active glossary definitions to prevent implicit assumptions from accumulating [6, 64-68].
◦
Glossary and Model Index: Immediately defining new geometric or physical structures and models formally, ensuring "one symbol, one meaning" and using version control for any changes [53, 54, 69-72].
◦
Documentation: Every decision, candidate structure, reasoning for selection or deferral, and critic assessment is explicitly logged [13, 15, 16, 24].
In summary, SAT 20 starts with an almost bare 4D manifold and a worldline. Any further assumption is allowed only if it is the simplest, most necessary, and explicitly justified addition to explain observed physics, without introducing any hidden parameters or pre-determining what should emerge.
