MASTER THREAD README 
Master Thread: If you are initiated as the Master Thread, you will take the content you are given at initiation, and proceed to construct the deliverables, *strictly* adhering to the Master Thread Instructions. You will title this "Module: [#]". E.g. O2, O3, etc.


SAT_O Testing Protocol (ULTRA-HOSTILE UPGRADE)

Version 2.0 | Date: [INSERT DATE]

Purpose:
---------
Define the upgraded, high-rigor audit procedure for all module-level testing in the SAT_O Project.

Master Testing Protocol:
--------------------------
For each assigned module:

1. **Definition Consistency**:
   - Verify that all terms used are rigorously defined in the provided Glossary excerpt.
   - Report any undefined or ambiguously defined terms.

2. **Logical Structure Validation**:
   - Check for internal logical consistency within the module.
   - Identify any unproven assertions, missing derivation steps, or logical fallacies.

3. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - Verify all mathematical derivations, including:
     - Proper use of tensors, spinors, differential forms.
     - Dimensional and unit consistency.
     - Correct application of topological or homological principles where applicable.

4. **Group-Theoretical Integrity**:
   - For gauge sectors:
     - Verify structure constants, commutation relations, representation theory.
     - Check for the presence of chiral/gauge anomalies.
     - Confirm if anomaly cancellation is plausible or indicated.

5. **Quantum Consistency Check**:
   - Check if quantum corrections (loop-level effects) are accounted for or could plausibly exist.
   - Test whether emergent constants (e.g., \( \hbar \), \( e \), \( G \)) scale plausibly under renormalization group flow assumptions.

6. **Falsifiability Assessment**:
   - Determine if the module makes clear, testable predictions or measurable claims.
   - Flag any unfalsifiable structures.

7. **Independence Verification**:
   - Confirm the module does not rely on information outside the provided content and glossary.
   - Report if external dependencies are detected.

8. **Hidden Parameter Scan**:
   - Identify any free parameters not justified or derived within the module.
   - Report instances of fine-tuning or arbitrary insertion.

9. **Failure Mode Analysis**:
   - Hypothesize scenarios under which the module could fail.
   - Provide at least one potential falsification pathway.

Module-Specific Testing Procedures:
------------------------------------
Each module will include a module-specific Testing Procedure, derived from this protocol, tailored to the specific content and context of the module.

Audit Report Requirements:
---------------------------
- **LaTeX Report**:
  - Abstract
  - Scope (module under test)
  - Methods (testing performed)
  - Findings (test results)
  - Critical Commentary (strengths, weaknesses, recommendations)
- **Checklist**:
  - Tabular pass/fail checklist matching the above tests.

Final Deliverable:
-------------------
Each thread must submit a LaTeX audit report and checklist for its assigned module.
