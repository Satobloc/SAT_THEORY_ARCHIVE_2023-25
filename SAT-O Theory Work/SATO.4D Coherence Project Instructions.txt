\section*{Instructions for Project Files Field}

This project is governed by a strict separation of core structural theory and interpretive or heuristic extensions.

\subsection*{Core File Set (Required)}
The following files constitute the minimal required materials for compliant participation in the SAT.O theory development effort:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SAT\_DIRECTIVES.txt} — Top-level development rules, purpose boundaries, and override mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{SAT\_CORE\_4D.txt} — Main SAT.O module container (O1 through O8).
    \item \textbf{SAT\_DEPLOYMENT\_GUIDELINES.txt} — Mode system, structural calculus, and interpretive policies.
    \item \textbf{SAT\_GLOSSARY\_FINAL.txt} — One-symbol, one-meaning geometric glossary.
\end{itemize}

These define the scope, intent, and interpretive control policies for the entire project.

\subsection*{Supplemental File Policy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item No legacy project files are to be reused unless explicitly reformatted for SAT.4D and integrated into the live derivation or compendium system.
    \item All future uploads must be clean, single-purpose, and directive-compliant.
    \item Each supplemental file must declare:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Which official directives it falls under.
            \item Its interpretive mode.
            \item Whether it is core, derived, or speculative.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Versioning Policy}

All materials are subject to continuous improvement. Only the currently loaded clean files form the working base. Past versions and legacy content must be archived or referenced explicitly.

\subsection*{Operational Reminder}

\textbf{All project tools, agents, and analysts must read the four clean files above before initiating any operation.}
