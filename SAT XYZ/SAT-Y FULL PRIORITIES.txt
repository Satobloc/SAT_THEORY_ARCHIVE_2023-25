Based on the sources and our conversation history, here is a list of goals set out for the next phase of SAT development, focusing on what remains to be done or is currently pending:
The next phase of SAT development is primarily structured around three major operational modes and several specific theoretical and documentation tasks.
Major Operational Modes for the Next Phase:
1.
Operational Mode: This mode involves the crucial step of applying the developed SATxy detection pipelines to real astronomical datasets.
◦
This phase is not yet started.
◦
It is contingent upon the release of specific next-generation survey data.
◦
Key datasets awaited include Gaia DR5, LSST early science data, Roman Space Telescope data, LiteBIRD data, CMB-S4 data, and NANOGrav 20-year results.
◦
The goal is to run the established pipeline on real observed streams, CMB maps, and GW datasets.
2.
Interpretation Mode: This phase occurs after the Operational Mode, involving the analysis of real data results – whether detections or non-detections.
◦
It is a future mode that is not yet started.
◦
If SATxy predictions are detected, the goal is to confirm the predictions and refine SATxy parameter values based on the real observations.
◦
If predictions are not detected, the goal is to set upper limits, revise field configurations, and check core assumptions.
3.
Extension Mode: This mode focuses on extending the SATxy framework toward full unification, quantum gravity, and quantum cosmology.
◦
This mode is also not yet started.
◦
Specific goals within this mode include:
▪
Including dynamical spacetime (building a quantum gravity theory).
▪
Building a full quantum cosmology based on the θ₄–ψ–τ sectors.
▪
Developing connections to problems like the cosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.
▪
Formalizing String Theory correspondences.
▪
Exploring deeper unification with string- or loop-like concepts.
Immediate Next Theoretical Steps (Prior to Extension Mode):
Even before formally entering Extension Mode, several theoretical tasks have been identified as immediate next steps if the focus remains on theory rather than real data:
•
Derive the complete SATxy Lagrangian density, including kinetic, potential, and coupling terms for θ₄, ψ, τ, emergent gauge fields, and embedded SM fields. This is the directed next major theoretical task.
•
Perform quantization on curved (cosmological/black hole) backgrounds.
•
Explore rare process predictions (e.g., flavor-changing decays, lab tests of ψ↔photon coupling, CP-odd effects) at laboratory scale.
Specific Tasks Identified as Pending or In Progress:
Several specific tasks within the SATxy framework are listed as "Pending," "In Progress," or needing completion in the various trackers and documents:
•
Standard Model Embedding (SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)): While marked as "Partial but Strong" with fundamental mappings existing, the rigorous completion of fermion mapping and anomaly cancellation proof is needed. Mapping ψ and θ₄ into the SU(2) × U(1) electroweak sector is a typical task. Building Yukawa-like effective couplings and predicting flavor violation probabilities are also related to this.
•
Prediction Scaffolding and Constants Extraction: Some predictions exist, but the test scaffolding and constants unification are incomplete. Finalizing constants unification and mass hierarchies is a goal for Phase 2 using [Pheno] + [Insight] modes. Extending Yukawa couplings is mentioned. Modeling low-energy signatures like Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) from residual θ₄ CPV is a next step. Exploring Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) signatures from rare τ-bound states is another.
•
QFT Dictionary and Crosswalks: Listed as "Pending" in one tracker, but marked as "Complete" in a strategic update. This involves finalizing the SAT ↔ QFT/SM operator dictionary and potentially expanding cross-dictionaries for SAT ↔ GR, QFT.
•
Spectral Decomposition: Marked as "Not Started" and assigned to [Prism] mode. The goal is to decompose SAT structures into symmetry, frequency bases.
•
Inverted/Alternative SAT Remapping (Twist Mode): Marked as "Not Started" and assigned to [Twist] mode. This involves exploring duals and counter-SATs.
•
Red-Team Adversarial Review (Critic Mode): Marked as "Pending". This is a full hostile critique phase.
•
Total Systems Reintegration (Sage Mode): Marked as "Pending". This is a grand unified map of SAT ↔ GR, SM, QFT, String Theory, integrating all predictions into a single, fractal map.
•
Complete SATxy Index / Document Index: Marked as "To be fleshed out" or "Skeleton Exists". It needs outline completion and cross-links filled.
•
Final Review / Gap Analysis: Marked as "Pending". It is slated to begin once the quantization and SM embedding tasks are complete.
•
Outreach & Public Documentation: Marked as "Early Drafts". While not a core scientific goal, it needs finishing touches. This involves developing the public-facing narrative and metaphors.
•
Lattice Simulation Readiness: Marked as "Complete" in one tracker, but the discretized simulation framework was previously noted as not finalized. Specific simulation runs for parameter space scan are outlined, aiming to map parameters to GW spectrum, UCMH mass function, and stellar stream gap statistics. Defining criteria for comparing simulations to data and mapping out observational forecast plots are also key simulation/prediction goals.
•
Formal Axiom Layer: Could use a more finalized, polished axiom sheet.
In summary, the upcoming phases will move from the completed core theory and preliminary prediction mapping towards applying the theory to real data (Operational/Interpretation modes) and extending the theoretical framework towards quantum gravity and full unification (Extension Mode), while also finalizing predictions, simulations, documentation, and addressing specific pending tasks identified in the development plan.
