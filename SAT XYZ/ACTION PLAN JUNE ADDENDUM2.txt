Core Theory and Foundations
◦
Reproduction of Newtonian/GR Physics is Partial; the full derivation needs finalization, specifically deriving the Newtonian and GR limit from the SAT strain tensor.
◦
Write Mecha Z (SAT Z Lagrangian v1).
◦
Enumerate all dimension-4 operators consistent with the final Ontology Z: self-couplings and kinetic terms for θ₄, ψ, τ, uᵘ, all gauge-emergent terms, any couplings to new ϕ_Z (if introduced).
◦
Write each operator with a reference “origin: (Z Module X)” and produce a LaTeX draft of L_{SAT Z}.
◦
Check reality/CPT: ensure no complex coefficients sneak in.
◦
Confirm the decoupling limit (if ϕ_Z → 0 recovers SATxy exactly).
◦
Lagrangian per Z-only fields remains open.
◦
Derive the complete SATxy Lagrangian density, including kinetic, potential, and coupling terms for θ₄, ψ, τ, emergent gauge fields, and embedded SM fields.
◦
Finalize Ontology Z: decide on any extra fields or symmetries, including deciding on ϕ_Z, choosing symmetry beyond ℤ₃, and committing the Ontology_Z_v1.txt file.
◦
Decide whether to introduce any Z-only field ϕ_Z (e.g., a radial θ₄ modulus or a 2-form C_{μν}).
◦
If ϕ_Z: write Axiom Z10 specifying its transformation and periodicity.
◦
Choose whether to include any discrete/higher-form symmetry beyond ℤ₃ (e.g., ℤ₄ “axion” or a 2-form gauge).
◦
If beyond ℤ₃: write corresponding periodicity axiom (analogous to Z1, Z5).
◦
Commit a standalone Ontology_Z_v1.txt and lock it.
◦
Lock Ontology QG (Metric Decision): Choose between “Fundamental Metric” vs. “Emergent Metric,” prepare actions accordingly, write Ontology_QG_v1.txt, and commit QG branches.
◦
Choose between “Fundamental Metric” vs. “Emergent Metric” for SAT QG.
◦
If “Fundamental”: prepare S_EH + S_{SAT Z}(θ₄, ψ, τ, uᵘ; g_{μν}).
◦
If “Emergent”: define composite operator ĝ_{μν}(θ₄, uᵘ) precisely and show how diffeomorphism invariance emerges.
◦
Write Ontology_QG_v1.txt capturing this decision and any sub-axioms.
◦
Commit all QG branches: ontology-qg-draft, mecha-qg-sketch, quant-qg-placeholder.
◦
uᵘ Status: Decide between Operator vs. Classical approximation.
◦
Symmetry Choice: Decide between Full Diff invariance vs. Horava foliation (and pick anisotropic scaling exponent z if Horava).
◦
τ-Sector Treatment: Decide between Sum over ℤ₃ flat connections vs. freeze τ.

Quantization
◦
Quantization on curved backgrounds (e.g., cosmological or black hole spacetimes, specifically FLRW) is a proposed next theoretical task.
◦
Write Wheeler–DeWitt (Quant Z). (Status: Planned).
◦
Path integral 1-loop β-functions (Quant Z). (Status: Planned).
◦
Search Asymptotic Safety (Quant Z). (Status: Planned).
◦
Quant QG: Canonical vs. Path integral (same as Quant Z, but with gravitational coupling included (Case A) or emergent metric/discrete graph (Case B)).
◦
Quant QG module status is Planned (outline).
◦
Define the canonical commutation relations explicitly.
◦
1-loop renormalizability proof (Item 19).

Standard Model and Bridge
◦
Higgs Mechanism Analog is Not Yet complete; the structure for ψ or θ₄ to act as a Higgs-like condensate is not complete. Need deeper work on Higgs physics.
◦
Neutrino Sector is Not Yet complete; there is no full mapping of neutrino masses/mixing yet, and neutrino ψ-holonomy needs work.
◦
Baryon/Lepton Number is only a Sketch; the full B–L symmetry has not yet been shown.
◦
Building Yukawa-like effective couplings.
◦
Predicting flavor violation probabilities.
◦
Extending Yukawa couplings.
◦
Sₚₚ calculation (#6a).
◦
ℏ and ε₀ conversion (#11/15 check).
◦
Chiral EFT → NN potential (Item 10) and the Proton–proton + NN phase shift submodule.
◦
Fusion S-factors (Item 11).
◦
Fission PES (Item 12).
◦
Nuclear reaction network (Item 13).

Predictions and Phenomenology
◦
The actual formulas, numerical forecasts, and error bars still need to be computed for some predictions (e.g., ℤ₃ confinement, weak-field GW deviations, neutrino-oscillation anomalies).
◦
Compute specific predictions like clock-drift vs. ∇θ₄, domain-wall interferometer phase maps, pulsar-timing templates, neutrino-oscillation holonomy predictions.
◦
Clock-drift & lab interferometer design (Item 17).
◦
Compute cross sections & decays for Z-sector (Pheno Z).
