First Priorities
(These tasks directly enable new, testable predictions in the next few months.)

Domain-Wall Interferometer Phase (due Jul 20, 2025)

Compute the fixed, wavelength-independent 0.24 rad phase shift across a θ₄ domain wall.

Deliver a “DomainWallPhase_SAT” memo showing δϕ(λ, wall thickness δ).

Pulsar-Timing Templates (due Aug 1, 2025)

Calculate timing‐residual templates δt(t) induced by SAT’s uᵘ-strain for millisecond pulsars.

Produce a “PulsarTiming_SAT” set of δt vs. frequency/time curves for NANOGrav/SKA.

Issue a “Spp_SAT” brief comparing S_pp⁽SAT⁾ to the PDG value.

Other Priorities
(These tasks strengthen SAT’s foundations and extend its modeling capabilities; they can follow once first priorities are underway.)

A. Scientific-Validation Tasks

Static Sun Field Equations (due Aug 30, 2025)

Solve SAT-Z’s PDEs for a spherically symmetric “Sun” (θ₄(r), uᵘ(r), ψ constant, τ = 0).

Publish “SunField_SAT” tables of δθ₄(r) and ϕ(r).

Mercury Perihelion Precession (due Sept 15, 2025)

Extract g_{μν}(r) to 1 PN from “SunField_SAT,” integrate Mercury’s geodesic over 100 years, and confirm Δϕ≈ 43″/century ± 0.1″.

Deliver “MercuryOrbit_SAT” simulation log.

Opacity-Table Verification (due Sept 30, 2025)

Compute Rosseland-mean opacities κ(ρ,T,X) from SAT’s emergent QED and confirm agreement with OPAL/OP to high precision.

Provide “Opacity_SAT” comparison tables.

τ-Ghosts & θ_QCD Anomaly Cancellation

Show that SAT’s topological τ-ghost terms cancel any would-be θ_QCD contributions, preserving QCD consistency.

Quantization on Curved Backgrounds

Extend SAT’s BRST quantization to cosmological/black-hole backgrounds and ensure no hidden inconsistencies.

Path-Integral 1-Loop β-Functions

Compute 1-loop corrections (κ, α, β, μ, …) in SAT’s canonical/path-integral framework and check for asymptotic safety or new divergences.

Full Yukawa Sector & Neutrino Mapping

Embed ψ-windings into explicit Yukawa couplings to reproduce all quark/lepton masses and CKM mixings.

Map ψ-holonomy onto neutrino-mass textures and mixing angles; verify consistency with oscillation data.

B–L Symmetry & Proton Stability

Demonstrate how SAT enforces or breaks global B and L (e.g., why proton decay is suppressed).

Prediction Scaffolding & Constants Unification

Finalize SAT’s unified set of fundamental constants (θ₄₀, Λ, etc.), ensure internal consistency of mass hierarchies, and confirm no residual contradictions.

B. Simulation & Modeling Tasks

3+1 D Lattice Code for θ₄, uᵘ, ϕ_Z

Build a grid solver with appropriate boundary conditions, validate static domain-wall and filament solutions, and begin early β-testing.

Sim Mercury: Geodesic Integrator

(Follows 1 B2) Implement a numerical geodesic solver in the SAT-corrected metric to support Mercury’s orbit validation.

Sim Stellar: 1D Hydrostatic Solver (e.g., SAT-MESA)

Integrate SAT’s hydrostatic equilibrium (dP/dr=–ρ G_eff M/r²), reaction rates from ψ-sector, and SAT opacities into a MESA-style code to produce HR tracks for 1 M_⊙.

SAT-Driven Nuclear Reaction Network

Create a reaction-network solver using SAT’s ψ-sector cross sections (pp chain, CNO, triple-α, etc.) and couple it to the 1D solver.

Sim Z: Monte Carlo Sampler & AMR

Implement a Monte Carlo sampler for random ℤ₃ τ-configurations, then develop adaptive mesh refinement for tracking θ₄ kink dynamics and collapse.

Emergent Metric Reconstruction Routines

Write code that reconstructs g_{μν}(x) from simulated θ₄ and uᵘ fields, enabling direct comparison to known GR metrics in various scenarios (e.g., black holes, cosmology).

Sphere Solver for θ₄ + uᵘ (due Aug 30, 2025)

Reduce the static Sun problem to two ordinary differential equations for θ₄(r) and uᵘ(r) and package a publicly documented code module for Solar solutions.

Simulated Stellar-Stream Pipeline

Complete a pipeline for mock stellar-stream/stellar-gap simulations using θ₄–uᵘ fields to predict faint substructures for Gaia/LSST comparisons.

By focusing first on the four “Falsifiable-Prediction” tasks in Section 1, we directly enable timely comparisons with summer/fall 2025 data (optical clocks, tabletop interferometry, NANOGrav). Once those are launched, we shift to “Scientific-Validation” work (Section 2 A) to cement SAT’s reproduction of known physics, and then build out the “Simulation & Modeling” infrastructure (Section 2 B) to support broader numerical tests and future predictions.
