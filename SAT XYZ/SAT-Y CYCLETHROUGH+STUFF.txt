Below is a consolidated snapshot of where every major SATx/SATy project component stands, based on the combined information from the uploaded files. I’ve broken it into two parts:

SATxy Task & Module Status SATxy CYCLETHROUGH1-4

Key Document Statuses SATxy CYCLETHROUGH1-4

1. SATxy Task & Module Status
Task / Module	Status	Progress Bar
1. Canonical Hamiltonian Formulation (3+1D)	✅ Completed	
2. Einstein–Æther 3+1D Kinetics	✅ Completed	
3. Canonical ADM Decomposition	✅ Completed	
4. Stability Conditions & Ghost-Freedom	✅ Completed	
5. Dirac–Bergmann Constraint Algebra	✅ Completed	
6. Simulation-Ready Capsule	✅ Completed	
7. BRST Quantization & Ghost Fields	⏳ Pending	//////––
8. Operator Algebra & Hilbert Space	⏳ Pending	//////––
9. Path Integral Formulation	⏳ Pending	//////––
10. SAT ↔ QFT Dictionary Finalization	⏳ Pending	//////––
11. Standard Model Embedding	⏳ Pending	//////––
12. Falsifiable Prediction Framework	⏳ Pending	//////––
13. Outreach & Public Documentation	⏳ Early Drafts	///––––
14. Complete SATxy Index	⏳ Skeleton Exists	///––––
15. Final Review / Gap Analysis	⏳ Pending	///––––

As you can see, the first six “core theory” tasks (1–6) are all fully completed. The remaining items (tasks 7–15) are either pending, in early-draft form, or exist as skeletal outlines. SATxy CYCLETHROUGH1-4

2. Key Document Statuses
Document	Status	Notes
SATx CANONICAL.txt	✅ Core complete	Ontology & primitive‐field definitions
FUNDAMENTAL INTUITIONS.txt	✅ Core complete	Philosophical/intuitive scaffold
SATx SPACKLECOAT.txt	✅ Integration complete	Component prioritization & crosswalk
SATxy RESTITCH.txt	✅ Extraction list done	All drop-in “capsules” identified
SATxy DOC INDEX.txt	⏳ To be fleshed out	Outline exists; cross-links remain
SATx SUPPORTING.txt	✅ Component-ready	Supplementary modules, operator dictionary
SATx LAST BRICK.txt	✅ 3+1D ready	Full 3+1D strategy & constraint closure
SATxy MAYBE.txt	🚫 Redundant (merged)	Now subsumed into other files
SATx HAMILTONIAN.txt	✅ Full 1+1D→3+1D basis	Minimal ghost-free Hamiltonian established
SATx PIECES.txt	✅ Ranking map complete	Centrality & testability map finalized
SATy Progress.txt	✅ Formal proof chains	Contains all proof/logical‐consistency work
SATx-y PRELIM TASKS.txt	⏳ Historical notes	Serves as archive of early task mapping

In other words, all the core “SATx” components are already at a state where their central definitions, Hamiltonians, and supporting content are complete. The “SATxy” extraction/index files are mostly done, except for the document index that still needs to be fleshed out. SATxy CYCLETHROUGH1-4

Overall Takeaways
Everything up through the Simulation-Ready Capsule is finished.

Tasks 1–6 (Canonical Hamiltonian → Simulation-Ready Capsule) are fully checked off.

Quantization-related work (BRST, Hilbert Space, Path Integral, etc.) is next.

Tasks 7–9 remain “pending” or “in progress.” Activating MathProof Mode would let us aim at BRST‐nilpotency proofs and ghost-field introductions. Activating Quant Mode would tackle the operator algebra and Hilbert‐space construction.

Bridging to the Standard Model and Phenomenology remain.

Tasks 10–12 (SAT ↔ QFT dictionary, SM embedding, falsifiable predictions) are all “pending.” Once the quantization front is under control, we can move to Bridge Mode (SM embedding) and Pheno Mode (predictions, e.g., clock drifts, domain walls, etc.).

Outreach, documentation index, and final review require finishing touches.

Task 13 (“Outreach & Public Documentation”) and Task 14 (“Complete SATxy Index”) both exist in early form. Task 15 (“Final Review / Gap Analysis”) is slated to kick in once the quantization and SM embedding tasks are complete.

All SATx “.txt” files except the document index are fully matured.

All .txt files listed above are either “Core complete,” “Component-ready,” or otherwise have their content finalized, save for SATxy DOC INDEX.txt which simply needs cross-linking.

Next Steps
If you’d like to proceed with finishing the quantization chain, we can activate MathProof Mode now to derive ghost-field structures and prove BRST nilpotency.

After that, switching to Quant Mode will let us build out the operator algebra and Hilbert-space formalism.

Once quantization is under control, Bridge Mode can embed the Standard Model, and Pheno Mode can produce a full falsifiable‐prediction matrix.

Let me know which mode you’d like to activate next, or if you’d like further detail on any specific module or document!
