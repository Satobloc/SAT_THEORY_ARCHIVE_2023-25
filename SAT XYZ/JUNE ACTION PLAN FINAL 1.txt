Summary of Today’s Deliverables (June 1, 2025)
Clock-Drift_SAT (one-page note with Δf/f formula).
DomainWallPhase_SAT (memo with δϕ vs λ, δ).
SunField_SAT ODEs (write down final static ODE system).
StellarHydro_SAT Template (Python skeleton with G_eff placeholder).
Over the next two weeks, I will complete those deliverables and circulate them for quick checks. By mid-June, we will have all three categories in motion, each with at least one concrete output:
Falsifiable Predictions: formulas ready to compare against clock, interferometer, and pulsar data.
Validation: explicit SAT Sun solution and stellar hydro module framework to confirm Mercury’s orbit and solar structure.
Simulations: proof-of-concept code skeletons that can be expanded into full SAT-Z lattice and geodesic solvers.
Once those are in hand, we will proceed to the next tier of tasks (full geodesic integration, opacity checks, Yukawa embedding, Sim Z initial grid, etc.) according to the schedules above.
