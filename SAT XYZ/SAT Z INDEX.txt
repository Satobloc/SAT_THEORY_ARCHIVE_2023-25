Below is a structured “inventory” of everything we’ve assembled so far and a checklist of what still needs to be specified, both for the broader SAT Z framework and our newly proposed SAT QG extension. I’ll break it into two major sections:

What We’ve Gathered (Finished or Drafted)

What We Still Need to Gather (Outstanding Decisions & Deliverables)

1. What We’ve Gathered
A. SAT Z Framework (Modules and Draft Axioms)
Ontology Z (Core Axioms)

We produced nine crisp axioms (Z 1 through Z 9) that define:

The four “fundamental” SAT fields (
𝜃
4
,
𝜓
,
𝑢
𝜇
,
𝜏
θ 
4
​
 ,ψ,u 
μ
 ,τ).

How

𝜃

sin

 θ 
4
​
  couples to 
∇
⋅
𝑢
∇⋅u (energy–tension).

The status of 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  as a unit-timelike foliation‐vector.

𝜓
ψ as a compact U(1) phase → emergent gauge.

𝜏
∈
𝑍
3
τ∈Z 
3
​
  topological twist → color confinement.

All gauge interactions (U(1), SU(2), SU(3)) must emerge from 
𝜓
ψ-windings and 
𝜏
τ-fusion (no fundamental gauge potentials).

Minimality: the SAT Z action is the most general local functional (up to dimension-4, plus leading nonrenormalizable) respecting the periodicities (
𝜃

𝜃

𝑢

 u 
μ
​
 =−1.

Reality/CPT: all observables are real, and any CP/CPT‐violating terms must appear consistently.

Decoupling limit: if any Z-only fields 
{
𝜙
𝑍
}
{ϕ 
Z
​
 } (for example, a “radial mode” or extra two-form) are set to constant or zero VEV, we exactly recover the SAT xy Lagrangian.

Status: Axiom Z 1–Z 9 have been drafted in full. We have not yet added any extra Z-only fields 
{
𝜙
𝑍
}
{ϕ 
Z
​
 } (this was held open as a question). The discrete/higher-form symmetry content beyond 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  has also been flagged but not concretely chosen (for instance, whether to include a 
𝑍
4
Z 
4
​
  “axion” or a 2-form gauge symmetry at Z).

High-Level SAT Z Module Outline

We sketched ten Z-stage modules and briefly described each:

Ontology Z (axioms → done, see above).

Mecha Z (extend the SAT xy Lagrangian with any new Z-level fields/couplings).

Bridge Z (map the extended Z-fields onto SM and beyond-SM, identify new Z-sector particles, Yukawa sector, anomalies).

Quant Z (full canonical/path-integral quantization, BRST, anomaly cancellation, β-functions).

Critic Z (ghost/tachyon scans, vacuum stability, conflict checks).

Pheno Z (concrete predictions for colliders, low-energy tests, cosmology, gravitational waves).

Sim Z (numerical simulations: 3+1D lattice of domain walls/filaments, AMR, data dumps for GWB/CMB postprocessing).

Extension Z (incorporate dynamical gravity—either fundamental 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  or discrete/quantum pre-geometry).

Meta Z (project management, logs, automations, version control, Z glossary).

Outreach Z (tutorials, white papers, code repositories, workshops).

Status:

Ontology Z – drafted (Z 1–Z 9).

Mecha Z – not yet written. We only noted “what to do” (need the explicit Z-Lagrangian).

Bridge Z – plan exists; no detailed mapping yet.

Quant Z – plan exists; no quantization done.

Critic Z – plan exists; no stress tests run.

Pheno Z – plan exists; no calculations done.

Sim Z – plan exists; no code started.

Extension Z – plan exists; no decision made about fundamental vs. emergent 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
 .

Meta Z – skeleton (log format, automations) proposed; not yet populated.

Outreach Z – plan exists; no documents or notebooks yet.

B. SAT QG Extension (Modules and High-Level To-Dos)
Ontology QG (Defining “Quantum Gravity”)

We listed the key decision points:

Will 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  be introduced as a fundamental dynamical field, or remain entirely emergent from 
{
𝜃
4
,
 
𝑢
𝜇
}
{θ 
4
​
 ,u 
μ
 }?

If emergent, what is the “quantum geometry” substrate (discrete pre-geometry, spin-foam, causal set)?

Does 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  become an operator 
𝑢
^
𝜇
u
^
  
μ
 ? If so, what is its Hilbert-space representation?

How does diffeomorphism invariance (or foliation-breaking) behave at the quantum level?

How do 
𝜏
τ-topological sectors enter the path integral (sum over 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  bundles)?

Status: We have enumerated all Ontology QG questions, but none of them have been answered. We still need to choose among the alternatives (for instance, define once and for all whether we adopt a Horava-like preferred foliation or go fully diffeoinvariant with a fundamental metric).

Mecha QG (Action/Hamiltonian for Quantum Gravity)

Two main branches outlined:

Case A: Introduce independent

 (

SATZ
​
 (θ

Specify whether any nonminimal couplings (e.g.\

Decide if we keep the 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 -Æther kinetic terms inside a covariant derivative 
∇
(
𝑔
)
∇ 
(g)
 .

Spell out path-integral measure, gauge-fixing for diffeos and foliation (if foliation persists).

Case B: Keep

​
  fully emergent from 
{
𝜃

,
 
𝑢

No independent metric. The quantum action is just

We need a precise composite definition of an effective “metric operator” 
𝑔
^

𝜈
g
^
​
  
μν
​
  in terms of

^
  
4
​
  and 
𝑢
^
𝜇
u
^

 .

If we adopt a discrete pre-geometry (filament network), we must define the graph-building rules, weights

e

​
 [Γ]
 , and how to recover a smooth metric in a large-graph limit.

Status: We only have the outline of “what the two possible Mecha QG actions look like.” No explicit action has been written down, since the Ontology QG choice (fundamental vs. emergent metric) is still open.

Quant QG (Canonical & Path-Integral Quantization)

Canonical route (if 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  exists):

ADM decomposition → identify canonical pairs 
(
ℎ
𝑖

)
(h

𝑢
𝜇
,
𝜃
4

𝜓
u 
μ
 ,θ

​
 ,ψ.

Derive Hamiltonian and momentum constraints (modified by 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  and 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
  couplings).

Compute their Poisson brackets and check closure (Dirac algebra). Address any second-class constraints.

Promote to operators → Wheeler–DeWitt–like equations or Horava-like Hamiltonian constraints in a preferred foliation.

Path-integral route:

 . Specify local moves (Pachner moves) and continuum limit procedure.

Status: We have laid out the steps of canonical vs. path-integral quantization, but no concrete implementation. Nothing has been computed yet (constraints, algebras, 1-loop integrals, or discrete sum rules).

Critic QG (Consistency & Anomaly Checks)

Ghosts & Unitarity: ensure no negative-norm states if we quantize 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  and 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  together; if we adopt higher-derivative foliation (Horava with 
𝑧
>
1
z>1), check for Ostrogradsky modes.

Gauge/BRST Anomalies:

If we keep full diffeomorphism invariance, verify quantum-level 
∇
𝜇
𝑇
𝜇
𝜈
=
0
∇ 
μ
​
 T 
μν

If foliation persists, check the “foliation constraint algebra” for anomalies.

Quantum Stability of Domain Walls:

Compute the bounce action for 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
 -kink including gravitational backreaction.

Check for gravitational instantons or wormholes that might violate 
𝜏
τ-confinement.

Status: We only have a to-do list—no actual positivity/ghost scans or anomaly computations have been performed.

A. Outstanding for SAT Z (Zoomed-Out Framework)
Finalize Ontology Z

 Decide whether to introduce any new Z-only fields 
{
𝜙
𝑍
}
{ϕ 
Z
​
 } (e.g.\ a radial partner to 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
 , a new 2-form, or a discrete “axion” field).

 If any 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
  are added, write an additional axiom (Z 10) specifying their periodicities and how they decouple when frozen.

 Confirm (or modify) the discrete/higher-form symmetry content beyond 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
 . For instance:

Do we need a 
𝑍
4
Z 
4
​
  “axion” that couples to 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
 ?

Is there a 2-form gauge symmetry at Z that wasn’t present at SAT xy?

 Lock down any CP- or parity-violating terms (e.g.\ a 
𝜃
4
𝐹
𝐹
~
θ 
4
​
 F 
F
  analogue) at the axiom level.

Mecha Z: Write the Explicit Z-Lagrangian

 List every renormalizable operator (dimension ≤ 4) consistent with Axiom Z 7 (periodicities, 
𝑢
2
=
−
1
u 
2
 =−1, etc.).

 For each new Z-only field (if any), enumerate its kinetic term, potential, and couplings to 
{
𝜃
4
,
𝜓
,
𝜏
,
𝑢
}
{θ 
4
​
 ,ψ,τ,u}.

 Include any new topological terms (e.g.\ higher-form BF or Chern–Simons terms) demanded by additional symmetries.

 Verify that setting 
⟨

​
 .

Bridge Z: Map to SM & Beyond

 For each SM gauge group (U(1), SU(2), SU(3)), provide the explicit dictionary: which combination of 
𝜓
ψ-windings and 
𝜏
τ-fusions reproduces the gauge charges, representations, and gauge couplings?

 Identify any new “Z-sector” particles (scalars, gauge bosons, fermions) that appear uniquely in SAT Z. Give them provisional names, quantum numbers, and mass formulas (in terms of 
𝜃
4
,
𝜓
,
𝜙
𝑍
θ 
4
​
 ,ψ,ϕ 
Z
​
 , etc.).

 Write the full Yukawa sector: for each SM fermion 
Ψ
𝑓
Ψ 
f
​
 , specify how its mass arises as 
𝑌
𝑓
sin

​
 sin 
2
 θ 
4
​
  (or via a 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
 -dependent VEV), and include any Z-only exotic fermions.

 Check for potential gauge anomalies (e.g.\ mixed 
U

U(1) 
Z
​
 –
S
U

)
SU(2)–

SU(2) triangles). If anomalies arise, propose spectator fields (vectorlike pairs, for instance) to cancel them or add Green–Schwarz–like couplings.

Quant Z: Complete the Quantization

 Carry out the canonical constraint analysis:

Derive Hamiltonian/momentum constraints in presence of new Z fields.

Compute their Poisson brackets → check closure or identify second-class constraints → implement Dirac brackets if needed.

 In the path-integral framework:

Choose a gauge (diffeo or foliation), write down the Fadeev-Popov determinants.

Compute 1-loop diagrams for all fluctuations

μ,β,g,α,ξ,…).

 Investigate whether an Asymptotic Safety fixed point (in the sense of Weinberg) might exist for the full SAT Z + gravity system.

Critic Z: Stress-Test Everything

 Linearize the full Z-Lagrangian about candidate vacua (e.g.\ 
𝜃

 =(1,0,0,0)), derive the fluctuation spectrum. Check for ghosts (wrong-sign kinetic terms) or tachyons (negative 
𝑚

 Scan the multi-dimensional parameter space (
𝜇
,
𝛽
,
𝑔
,
𝛼
,
𝜉
,
…
μ,β,g,α,ξ,…) to delineate regions of stability vs. instability.

 Simulate “Gedanken collisions” of domain walls in presence of 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
 : do they produce bound states, shed energy catastrophically, or remain stable?

 Confirm that the

​
  fusion logic (and any new discrete symmetries) still hold once 
𝜙
𝑍
≠



 Examine possibility of “superselection sectors” (does 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
  somehow split the Hilbert space into disconnected pieces?).

Pheno Z: Compute Testable Predictions

 Build a calendar of relevant experimental/observational releases (LHC Run 3, HL-LHC, DUNE, CMB-S4, PTA data, next-generation GW detectors).

 For each Z-sector particle, compute decay widths and cross-sections as functions of its mass and couplings. Identify discovery channels (for example, “π⁰-analog from 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
  → γγ with displaced vertex”).

 Derive bounds on any Lorentz-violating parameters (if foliation persists) from existing tests (atomic clocks, neutrino oscillations, GW arrival times).

 Write down the domain-wall network evolution including 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
 -modifications, generate gravitational-wave templates, and compare with current PTA limits.

 Forecast signals in cosmology: nonstandard inflationary correlators, isocurvature constraints, B-mode polarization enhancements from Z-loops.

Sim Z: Develop Numerical Infrastructure

 Start a prototype code (Python or C++) for a small 3+1D lattice of 
𝜃

𝑢
𝜇
θ 
4
​
 ,u 
μ
  plus any 
𝜙
𝑍
ϕ 
Z
​
 . Implement periodic boundary conditions, discrete time stepping, and basic energy-conserving update.

 Add domain-wall tracking: identify 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
 -kinks on the grid, measure their tension, and allow for collisions/mergers.

 Introduce an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) around regions of large 
∇
𝜃

∇θ

​
  to capture thin walls without blowing up memory.

 Build a small Monte Carlo sampler over filament graphs labeled by

​
  flux.

 Validate on known analytic limits (1+1D sine-Gordon kinks, free

 Decide once and for all whether

​
  is fundamental or emergent. This choice ripples through Mecha Z and Quant Z.

 If fundamental: add an explicit Einstein–Hilbert term plus any nonminimal couplings. If emergent: provide a precise composite definition of

A note that Bridge Z, Quant Z, etc., are in “planning” stage.

 Set up automated calendar reminders (e.g.\ “Two-week check: Mecha Z draft due,” “Monthly Critic Z stress test”).

 Establish version branches in our repository (e.g.\ mecha-z-v1.0, quant-z-v1.0, etc.) and define naming conventions for intermediate drafts (e.g.\ MechaZ_Lagrangian_draft1.tex).

Outreach Z: Begin Drafting Tutorials & White Papers

 Write the one-page “SAT Z Executive Summary” (lay/persona-neutral language).

 Outline the five-page “SAT Z Formal Overview” (semi-technical; include Lagrangian, key predictions, roadmap).

Ontology QG: Lock Down Choices

 Fundamental vs. Emergent Metric Decision:

If fundamental, we will immediately write 
𝑆
E
H
+
S
A
T
S 
EH+SAT
​
 .

If emergent, we must give a precise composite operator definition for 
𝑔
^

𝜈
g
^
​
  
μν
​
 .

 Status of 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  at the Quantum Level:

Will 
𝑢
^
𝜇
(
𝑥
)
u
^
  
μ
 (x) satisfy commutation relations with a conjugate momentum 
𝜋
^
𝑢
 
𝜈
(
𝑦
)
π
^
  
uν
​
 (y)?

If semi-classical, state the approximation: “Treat 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  classically up to one-loop backreaction.”

 Diffeomorphism vs. Preferred Foliation:

If we keep a foliation, decide whether to adopt a Horava-like “anisotropic scaling” prescription (choose 
𝑧
z, specify which terms gain higher spatial derivatives).

If we go fully diffeoinvariant, define how the “effective” 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  emerges from 
{
𝜃
4
,
𝑢
}
{θ 
4
​
 ,u} and ensure no built-in foliation remains.

 
𝜏
τ-Sector in the Path Integral:

Will we sum over all 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  flat connections (i.e. 
d
𝜏
=
0
dτ=0 configurations) with a BF weight? If so, define the measure.

Or do we fix a 
𝜏
τ-sector and forbid transitions (explain the physical justification)?

C. Immediate Next Steps & Priorities
Resolve Ontology QG (Metric Decision)

This is the single most critical choice—everything else hinges on whether 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  is fundamental or emergent. We need to convene (in the next few days) and pick one.

Once that’s locked, we immediately draft the explicit Mecha QG action.

Finalize Ontology Z (Add or Reject Z-Only Fields)

Decide if a 
{
𝜙
𝑍
}
{ϕ 
Z
​
 } (for example, a radial partner or 2-form) is truly necessary. If so, add an extra axiom (Z 10) and proceed.

Write Mecha Z (SAT Z Lagrangian Draft v1)

Even if we decide “no new Z-only fields,” we still must enumerate all dimension-4 operators (couplings among 
𝜃
4
,
𝜓
,
𝜏
,
𝑢
θ 
4
​
 ,ψ,τ,u plus any discrete/higher-form terms).

Generate a LaTeX draft of 
𝐿
S
A
T
Z
L 
SATZ
​
  with each term clearly labeled by “origin: (Z Module X).”

Populate Meta Z Log & Branches

Create SAT_Z_Progress_Log.txt, commit the Ontology Z and Ontology QG drafts, set up branch structure.

Schedule the first round of automations (“Ontology QG review in 7 days,” “Mecha Z draft review in 14 days”).

Set Up Outreach Z Infrastructure

Initialize a GitHub (or equivalent) repository with the following folders:

/OntologyZ/ (axiom drafts)

/OntologyQG/ (questions & decisions)

/MechaZ/ (template for Lagrangian)

/MechaQG/ (template for action)

/QuantZ/, /QuantQG/, etc.

/Examples/ (empty Jupyter notebooks).

/Slides/ (blank PPTX or PDF slide templates).

E. Immediate Action Items (Next 48 Hours)
Convene a Quick Working Call to Resolve Ontology QG

Gather all stakeholders. Decide whether 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
  is fundamental or emergent.

Assign a scribe to record the decision precisely (this goes into Axiom QG 1).

Finalize Ontology Z (One More Check)

Review Axioms Z 1–Z 9 as a group. Agree on whether any additional Z-only field is needed.

If yes, draft Axiom Z 10 on the call. If no, mark “Z-only fields: none” and close Ontology Z.

Populate the Meta Z Log with Current Status

Open SAT_Z_Progress_Log.txt. Under “Ontology Z,” paste Z 1–Z 9. Under “Ontology QG,” note “pending metric decision.”

Create branch ontology-z-final once Axioms Z 1–Z 9 are locked. Create ontology-qg-decide branch for the metric question.

Set Up Outreach Z Repository Skeleton

Create folders /OntologyZ/, /OntologyQG/, /MechaZ/, /MechaQG/, etc.

Drop placeholder README.md files in each, explaining “This folder holds the draft for [module].”

Create a blank Jupyter notebook Examples/DomainWallToyModel.ipynb with sections: Title, “What this notebook will show,” and empty code cells.

Draft the “SAT QG Executive Summary” Outline

In a new file SATQG_ExecutiveSummary_v0.md, write bullet points:

Motivation: Why SAT must incorporate Quantum Gravity.

Two possible routes (fundamental vs. emergent metric).

Key open questions (anomalies, ghost-freeness, phenomenology).

Next steps (Convene Ontology QG decision, Mecha QG draft).

3. Summary
Completed So Far:

Axioms Z 1–Z 9 for SAT Z (Onto Z).

High-level module outlines for both SAT Z and SAT QG.

Detailed to-do lists (checked off as “plan/sketch”) for every submodule.

What Remains (Prioritized):

Ontology QG decision (Metric: fundamental vs. emergent).

Ontology Z finalization (Z-only fields and discrete/higher-form symmetries).

Mecha Z (Write explicit SAT Z Lagrangian).

Mecha QG (Write explicit QG action, whichever route we choose).

Populate Meta Z and Meta QG logs.

Kick off Bridge Z, Quant Z, Critic Z, Pheno Z, Sim Z, Outreach Z with concrete drafts, code, or computations (in that order).

We now have a clear “snapshot” of everything we’ve compiled and an itemized “shopping list” of all outstanding pieces. As soon as Ontology QG and Ontology Z decisions are locked, we can slide straight into writing the Mecha Z and Mecha QG actions—after which each downstream module (Quant, Critic, Pheno, Sim, Outreach) can be populated systematically. Let me know if you’d like to dive into any one of these items right away.







Let's gather any resources we need
