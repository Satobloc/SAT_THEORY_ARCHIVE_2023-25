Here are the remaining tasks, organized by section:
Core Theory and Foundations
•
No additional “Z-only” fields (ϕ_Z) have yet been introduced; the possibility has been noted but left open.
•
Gaps: The actual formulas, numerical forecasts, and error bars still need to be computed for some predictions (e.g., ℤ₃ confinement, weak-field GW deviations, neutrino-oscillation anomalies).
•
Finalize Ontology Z: Decide on any extra fields or symmetries (Axiom Z 1–Z9 already drafted).
◦
Decide whether to introduce any Z-only field ϕ_Z (e.g., a radial θ₄ modulus or a 2-form C_{μν}). If yes: write Axiom Z10.
◦
Choose whether to include any discrete/higher-form symmetry beyond ℤ₃ (e.g., ℤ₄ “axion” or a 2-form gauge). If yes: write corresponding periodicity axiom. Sean Carroll's suggestion to show emergence of a gauge symmetry, specifically challenging the model to demonstrate how a local U(1) gauge invariance could emerge from coil interactions in a toy model, directly relates to this task.
◦
Commit a standalone Ontology_Z_v1.txt and lock it.
•
Write Mecha Z (SAT Z Lagrangian v1).
◦
Enumerate all dimension-4 operators consistent with the final Ontology Z: self-couplings and kinetic terms for θ₄, ψ, τ, uᵘ, all gauge-emergent terms, any couplings to new ϕ_Z (if introduced). Sean Carroll's suggestions, such as starting with a simple toy model action and demonstrating gauge symmetry emergence, relate to developing this Lagrangian.
◦
Write each operator with a reference “origin: (Z Module X)” and produce a LaTeX draft of L_{SAT Z}.
◦
Check reality/CPT: ensure no complex coefficients sneak in.
◦
Confirm the decoupling limit (ϕ_Z → 0 recovers SATxy exactly).
•
Lock Ontology QG (Metric Decision).
◦
Choose between “Fundamental Metric” vs. “Emergent Metric” for SAT QG. Sean Carroll's suggestion to demonstrate gravitational coupling aligns strongly with the "Emergent Metric" option.
◦
If “Fundamental,” prepare S_EH + S_{SAT Z}(θ₄, ψ, τ, uᵘ; g_{μν}).
◦
If “Emergent,” define composite operator ĝ_{μν}(θ₄, uᵘ) precisely and show how diffeomorphism invariance emerges. Sean Carroll asks how distortions translate into a metric satisfying Einstein's equations and suggests demonstrating this emergence, even approximately, in a simplified setting.
◦
Write Ontology_QG_v1.txt capturing this decision and any sub-axioms.
◦
Commit all QG branches: ontology-qg-draft, mecha-qg-sketch, quant-qg-placeholder.
◦
uᵘ Status: Operator vs. Classical approximation.
◦
Symmetry Choice: Full Diff invariance vs. Horava foliation (and pick anisotropic scaling exponent z if Horava).
◦
τ-Sector Treatment: Sum over ℤ₃ flat connections vs. freeze τ.
•
Explicit field solutions remain open. Sean Carroll's suggestion to use a 1+1D toy model to reproduce a known QFT is a specific approach that could contribute to deriving explicit field solutions.
•
Lagrangian per Z-only fields remains open.
•
Reproduction of Newtonian/GR Physics is Partial; full derivation needs finalization. Sean Carroll suggests showing that in the low-energy limit, filaments move as though in a curved metric and demonstrating this emergence in a simplified setting, which directly addresses this gap. He also asks if there is an action combining Einstein-Hilbert and a filament action.
Quantization
•
Ensure that τ-ghosts cancel any would-be θ_QCD anomalies.
•
Quantization on curved (cosmological/black hole) backgrounds is a proposed next theoretical task.
•
Write Wheeler–DeWitt (Quant Z). (Note: Source lists Quant Z module status as Planned, needing to-do lists, and lower priority, while Source states Quant Z is complete).
•
Path integral 1-loop β-functions (Quant Z). (Note: Source lists Quant Z module status as Planned, needing to-do lists, and lower priority, while Source states Quant Z is complete).
•
Search Asymptotic Safety (Quant Z). (Note: Source lists Quant Z module status as Planned, needing to-do lists, and lower priority, while Source states Quant Z is complete).
•
Quant QG: Canonical vs. Path integral (same as Quant Z, but with gravity).
•
Path Integral Formulation is Pending in one list. (Note: Contradicts audit. Source does not explicitly state Path Integral Formulation is complete, while Source states general Quantization is Complete).
•
Path Integral Formulation status is marked as In Progress in one place. (Note: Contradicts audit. Source does not explicitly state Path Integral Formulation is complete, while Source states general Quantization is Complete). Sean Carroll's suggestion to use a 1+1D toy model and quantize it relates to the Path Integral Formulation task.
•
Quant QG module status is Planned (outline) in one overview and marked as needing to-do lists.
•
Define the canonical commutation relations explicitly.
•
Construct the path-integral formulation and explicitly show equivalence to canonical quantization. (Note: Source does not explicitly state Path Integral Formulation is complete, while Source states general Quantization is Complete).
Standard Model and Bridge
•
Write full Yukawa sector (SM & exotic fermions).
•
Higgs Mechanism Analog is Not Yet; ψ or θ₄ needs to act as a Higgs-like condensate—structure not complete.
•
Neutrino Sector is Not Yet; no full mapping of neutrino masses/mixing yet. (Note: Source also lists neutrino-oscillation anomalies needing numerical computation).
•
Baryon/Lepton Number is Sketch; full B–L symmetry not yet shown.
•
Building Yukawa-like effective couplings and predicting flavor violation probabilities are related tasks.
Predictions and Phenomenology
•
The actual formulas, numerical forecasts, and error bars still need to be computed for some predictions (e.g., ℤ₃ confinement, weak-field GW deviations, neutrino-oscillation anomalies). (Note: Source lists Pheno Z module status as Planned and lower priority, while Source states Pheno Z is complete).
•
Compute clock-drift vs. ∇θ₄, domain-wall interferometer phase maps, pulsar-timing templates, neutrino-oscillation holonomy predictions. (Note: Source lists Pheno Z module status as Planned and lower priority, while Source states Pheno Z is complete).
•
Compute cross sections & decays for Z-sector (Pheno Z). (Note: Source lists Pheno Z module status as Planned and lower priority, while Source states Pheno Z is complete).
•
Derive GWB templates & GUP (Pheno Z). (Note: Source lists Pheno Z module status as Planned and lower priority, while Source states Pheno Z is complete and mentions GUP as a highlight).
•
Inflationary & CMB corrections (Pheno Z). (Note: Source lists Pheno Z module status as Planned and lower priority, while Source states Pheno Z is complete and mentions CMB as a highlight).
•
Prediction Scaffolding and Constants Extraction: Some predictions exist, but the test scaffolding and constants unification are incomplete. Finalizing constants unification and mass hierarchies is a goal. Extending Yukawa couplings is mentioned. Modeling low-energy signatures like Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) from residual θ₄ CPV is a next step. Exploring Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) signatures from rare τ-bound states is another.
•
Pheno QG module outline is sketched and marked as Planned (sketch) in one overview, needing to derive specific predictions.

•
Derive BH entropy shift ΔS_SAT (Pheno QG).
•
Derive CMB TB/EB if CP violation exists (Pheno QG). (Note: Source lists CMB as a highlight).
•
Rare process predictions (e.g., flavor-changing decays, lab tests of ψ↔photon coupling, CP-odd effects) need completion at laboratory scale.
•
Additional cosmological observables (e.g., isocurvature, small-scale structure from τ sector) need completion. (Note: Source states Cosmological Prediction Mode is complete, but this specific task is listed as needing completion).
•
Compute potentially observable lab signatures (e.g., light-shining-through-walls experiments).
Simulations
•
Implement Lattice code for θ₄, u, ϕ_Z (Sim Z). (Note: Source notes Lattice Simulation Readiness was previously not finalized, while Source states Lattice Simulation Readiness is Completed).
•
Implement Graph MC sampler (Sim Z).
•
Implement AMR for domain walls (Sim Z).
•
Implement emergent metric reconstruction (Sim Z). This task aligns with Sean Carroll's suggestion to demonstrate gravitational coupling and show how distortions relate to a metric.
•
Sim QG module outline is sketched and marked as Planned (outline) in one overview, needing implementation similar to Sim Z but including gravity or emergent metric mapping.
•
Simulation & Visualization is Minimal; Sim mode is light, Viz mode is underused.
•
Specific simulation runs for parameter space scan are outlined. Defining criteria for comparing simulations to data and mapping out observational forecast plots are also key simulation/prediction goals.
