
SATO/Blockwave Framework: Comparative Assessment of Physics Models
The SATO/Blockwave framework (SAT) is assessed against other leading models (Standard Model/GUTs, String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity) based on its structural derivation of physical constants and its accuracy in retrodicting known physical phenomena.

SATO/Blockwave TRANSITION
50 sources
The provided documents center on two competing, highly detailed theoretical frameworks in fundamental physics: Scalar‚ÄìAngular‚ÄìTwist (SAT) and Quantum Filament Theory (QFiT). The SAT source documents, presented as internal project notes for a white paper, rigorously detail the derivation of fundamental constants like $c$, $\hbar$, $e$, $G$, and $\alpha$ from a minimal set of four fundamental fields, while simultaneously confirming the emergence of the Standard Model structure and providing falsifiable predictions (e.g., clock drift). The QFiT excerpts, a theory positioning itself as a Grand Unified Theory (GUT), propose that all reality‚Äîmatter, forces, and spacetime‚Äîarises from a cubic lattice of one-dimensional filaments possessing tension and phase, resolving problems like quantum gravity and dark matter through filament dynamics. Supplemental materials provide Standard Model particle listings and known empirical values for the constants being theoretically derived by both frameworks. A final source, SATOBLOCK-LIVE.txt, further audits the SAT/Blockwave formalism, confirming the Topological Mass Suppression mechanism and the theory's structural sufficiency for UV finiteness.
