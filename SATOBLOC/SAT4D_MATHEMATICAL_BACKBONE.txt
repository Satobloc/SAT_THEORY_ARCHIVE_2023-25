Based on the provided sources, the core mathematical backbone of the SAT theory can be extracted as follows:
The theory is constructed upon a 4D smooth differentiable manifold (M or R3,1). Within this manifold exists the fundamental object: a real 1D physical filament (γ), which is a smooth worldline embedded in the spacetime. Each filament is parameterized by an affine parameter λ, with its motion described by a tangent vector vµ = dxµ/dλ. Filaments possess intrinsic tension and vibrational dynamics. The fundamental action for a filament γ is given by S[γ] = ∫ dλL(γµ, vµ), with a Lagrangian potentially involving a kinetic term and a tension potential L = 1/2 mvµvµ − Vtension(γ), where 'm' is a tension mass-equivalent parameter.
A central concept is the 3D resolving or time slicing surface (Σt), which propagates through the static 4D block. The dynamics experienced by observers arise from the intersection of Σt with the filamentary structure. The movement of Σt is guided by a time-flow vector field uµ(x), which is the normal vector to Σt.
Key emergent geometric structures are defined through the properties and collective behavior of these filaments and their interaction with Σt:
•
The emergent co-metric g̃µν(x) is derived from the ensemble average of filament tangent vectors: g̃µν(x) = ⟨vµvν⟩. The emergent metric gµν(x) is the inverse of g̃µν. The metric is understood to emerge from filament density and alignment.
•
The emergent connection Γλµν(x) arises from the statistical average of local connection coefficients induced by filament shear and twist. This connection is torsion-free and metric-compatible (∇λgµν = 0).
•
The emergent curvature tensor Rρ σµν(x) and Ricci curvature Rµν(x) emerge from filament distortion, local twist and shear of filament bundles, and are defined as the statistical average of curvature contributions from filament distortion. Ricci curvature is also stated to be proportional to the gradient of the linking density: Rµν(x) ∝ ∇µ∇ν (ρlinking(x)).
•
The Strain tensor Sµν(x) is derived from the time-flow vector field: Sµν = ∇µuν +∇νuµ. It captures the local shearing and bending of the time surface.
•
The Misalignment angle θ4(x) measures the local angular deflection induced by the wavefront Σt upon intersection with a filament's tangent vector vµ(x). It is formally defined by cos(θ4(x)) = vµ(x)uµ(x) / (∥vµ(x)∥∥uµ(x)∥). It is interpreted as mass density or inertia. Local ∇µθ4(x) contributes to strain Sµν.
Topology plays a crucial role, with physical properties emerging from discrete topological invariants of the filaments and filament bundles:
•
Topological Invariants include Winding Number (n), Linking Number (Lk), Triple Linking (Br), and Knot complexity (degree of Jones polynomial, degPJones).
•
The Twist sector (τ(x)) captures local rotational winding and is interpreted as internal quantum number(s).
•
Topological Densities such as ρwinding, ρlink, and ρtriplelink are key statistical quantities.
•
Self-Linking (Framing) Number (SL ∈ Z/2) is the source of spin.
Key emergent quantities and fields are derived from these structures and topology:
•
Mass emerges from topological strain and local misalignment angle. The effective mass m(x) is proportional to the local interaction angle with the wavefront: m(x) ∼ T · sin²(θ4(x)). There is a mechanism for topological mass suppression where the effective mass is given by the core mass divided by a topological quantum number Q: m(eff)ψ = m(0)ψ / Q, where Q = ∏ pairs (1 + |Lk|)× ∏ triplets (1 + |Br|)× (1 + n)× (1 + deg(PJones)). Mass scaling is related to topological complexity: Mbundle ~ f(topological complexity).
•
Charge emerges from the winding number (q = e × n) and filament linking density.
•
Spin emerges from the self-linking (framing) number (half-integer for fermions, integer for bosons).
•
Flavor emerges from knot complexity (degree of knot invariant).
•
Gauge Potentials (Aµ(x), Lµ(x), Wa µ (x), GA µ(x)) emerge from local linking, twisting, and phase coherence/gradients of filament bundles. For electromagnetism, Aµ(x) ∼ f(ρwinding(x)) or Aµ(x) = ⟨Phase Gradient Structure⟩F(x).
•
Gauge Field Strength Tensors (Fµν, FA µν) are derived from gauge potentials and structural constants (for non-abelian fields). Fµν(x) = ∂µAν(x)− ∂νAµ(x). FA µν(x) = ∂µA A ν − ∂νA A µ + gsfABCABµACν.
•
Matter/Spinor Fields (ψ(x), ψa(x)) emerge from local twist states of filament bundles. They represent effective spin-1/2 modes from filament twist structures. The emergent Dirac Matrices γµ(x) represent local 4D orientation operators satisfying the Clifford algebra {γµ, γν} = 2gµνI.
•
Scalar Fields (ϕ(x), ϕH(x)) emerge from large-scale coherent vibrational modes or coherent oscillatory modes of filament bundles. Mass of scalar fields corresponds to topological strain energy density.
•
Emergent Stress-Energy Tensor Tµν(x) captures the emergent matter-energy content from local filament vibrational energy density Evib(x) and topological linking density Llink(x): Tµν(x) = ⟨Evib(x),Llink(x)⟩F(x).
•
Emergent Current Densities (Jµ, JAν) arise from filament flux, linking density, and spinor fields: Jµ(x) = ⟨Filament Flux and Linking Density⟩F(x) or Jµ(x) = eψ̄(x)γµ(x)ψ(x). For color current JAν = gsψ̄γνTAψ.
•
Emergent Gauge Coupling Constants (gG) are inversely related to linking densities and the filament scale: gG ∼ 1 / (√ρlinking,G ℓf).
•
Emergent Constants include Λinduced ~ 1/(32π²ℓf⁴) and Ginduced ~ 36π log(T/(2A)). An effective Planck constant ℏeff emerges from filament transverse scale and tension.
The dynamics and interactions are described by emergent field equations and principles:
•
The Emergent Klein-Gordon equation for scalar fields: (□+m²)ϕ(x) = 0, where □ϕ(x) = gµν∇µ∇νϕ(x) uses the emergent metric and covariant derivative.
•
The Emergent Path Integral Z = ∫ DF eiS[F] describes the statistical sum over possible filament bundle configurations. DF is the measure over filament bundle configurations, and S[F] = ∫ d⁴x Leff(F, ∂µF) is the emergent effective action. Quantum fluctuations correspond to statistical variability in filament configurations.
•
The Emergent Dirac Equation for spinor fields: (iγµ(∂µ + ieAµ)−m)ψ = 0. For quarks, it includes the color gauge field: (iγµDµ −m)ψa = 0 with covariant derivative Dµ = ∂µ + igsA AµTA.
•
The Emergent Maxwell Equations: ∂µFµν(x) = µ0 ⟨Filament Flux Density⟩F(x) (inhomogeneous) and ∂λFµν(x) + ∂µFνλ(x) + ∂νFλµ(x) = 0 (homogeneous, Bianchi identity).
•
The Emergent Yang-Mills Equations for non-abelian gauge fields (like gluons): ∂µFA µν + gsfABCABµFC µν = JAν.
•
The Emergent Einstein Field Equations: ⟨Rµν − 1/2 gµνR⟩F = κ ⟨Evib,Llink⟩F, where κ = 8πG/c⁴ and the averaging ⟨...⟩F signifies statistical emergence from the filament ensemble.
•
Thermodynamic quantities emerge statistically: Temperature T(x) ∝ ⟨Rate of Change of Local Linking/Winding Density⟩, Entropy S = kB log Ωtopology, and Topological Free Energy F = Etopology − TS.
•
Cosmological expansion emerges as a topological dilation: the emergent scale factor a(t) ∝ 1/(ρlinking(t))¹/³.
•
Black hole entropy is proportional to linking complexity across the horizon: SBH ∝ ∑horizon |Lk(γi, γj)|.
•
Speculatively, supersymmetry-like structures may arise from a topological duality between longitudinal filament modes ξµbosonic (vibrations) and transverse writhing modes ζµfermionic. Quantization of ζµ may induce anti-commutation relations {ζµ(λ), ζν(λ′)} = 0.
The mathematical tools employed include topological invariants, angular projections, covariant derivatives, integral functionals (actions, path integrals), statistical averaging over filament ensembles, dimensional analysis, and the formulation of Topological Renormalization Group (TRG) equations like dgG / d log Λ = βG(gG) describing the flow of coupling constants based on topological density evolution under coarse-graining.
The core principles guiding this mathematical formulation are: Structure first, dynamics emergent. All observable reality arises from intersection-driven structural emergence. The development occurs strictly within the Mode 1: True Block framework, assuming a static 4D block where dynamics solely stem from the movement of Σt. Physics is recast as the analysis of fixed 4D geometric relationships and topological invariants.Based on the provided sources, the core mathematical backbone of the SAT (Scalar-Angular-Torsion) theory is a geometric reinterpretation of known physics within a fully four-dimensional (4D) filamentary structure. The development focuses on structural rigor and proceeds strictly under the assumption of a static 4D block universe, where the only dynamical element in the core theory development framework (Mode 1) is the movement of a time slicing surface, Σt, through this block.
Here are the key mathematical components and concepts as described in the sources:
