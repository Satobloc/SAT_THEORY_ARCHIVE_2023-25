Can you do a search for any information about scientific investigations or experiments that are planning to release findings soon? Specifically, anything of course that is likely to intersect with SAT predictions… Basically, I want to be able to check the science news, predictions in hand, to see whether we can actually make some, before the data are released

🧭 Where to Focus Your Prediction Efforts
If you're aiming to publish or timestamp predictions before data come out, these seem the most promising areas to target immediately:

Atomic clock drift tied to θ₄ gradients:

SAT predicts non-standard drift patterns for atomic clocks in gravitational potential gradients without needing a pure metric curvature model.

Action: Predict drift rates between Earth-based clocks at different altitudes — including subtle deviations from GR redshift.

Pulsar timing anomalies:

Watch new data releases from projects like NANOGrav, EPTA, or SKA.

Action: Forecast a timing residual pattern based on local strain in 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 —a non-metric source of curvature.

Fixed 0.24 rad optical phase shifts:

Look for papers on topological phase experiments or interferometric birefringence.

Action: Predict a wavelength-independent (geometric) fixed phase shift across engineered domain walls.

Quantum simulations (ℤ₃ anyon systems):

Watch trapped-ion or cold-atom experiments simulating ℤ₃ topological order.

Action: Forecast domain-wall tension and fusion-rule confinement observable in these systems.

Neutrino anomalies:

Track next results from DUNE, JUNO, or Hyper-Kamiokande.

Action: Propose small shifts in expected mass-squared differences or flavor-mixing angles due to geometric ψ effects.

⏳ Timing Windows
NANOGrav 15-year dataset update — already started analysis, more results expected late 2025.

LIGO O4 run — results possible late 2025 or early 2026.

Next-gen atomic clocks — advances and new comparisons every 6–12 months (e.g., NIST Ca clock vs. Sr optical clocks).

Quantum simulators — ℤ₃ topological order demonstrations are being published right now (watch Nature, PRL, arXiv).

Hyper-Kamiokande — early data-taking starts 2027, but precommissioning oscillation data might leak sooner.

🧠 Summary of High-Confidence, Early Opportunity
🥇 First Prediction Target: Clock drift — you have very high confidence predictions and experimentalists (JILA/NIST, ACES) are actively improving precision now.

🥈 Second Target: Optical phase shift — 0.24 rad shift is hard and geometric; simple tabletop experiments are ongoing or could be nudged by outreach.

🥉 Third Target: Pulsar timing deviations — high confidence due to parallel with Lorentz-violating theories.

⚡ Strategy Recommendations
Summer–Fall 2025: Pulsar timing predictions (NANOGrav / SKA) — high payoff, high risk.

Fall–Winter 2025: Optical clock drift — very high probability, major prestige if you’re early.

Flexible: Optical phase shift — possibly collaborate or nudge experiments; it’s very falsifiable.
