\subsection*{SAT\_O 2.0 Module O1: 4D Hyperhelical Filament Dynamics}

\subsection*{Foundational Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The fundamental objects are \textbf{1D physical filaments} embedded in 4D spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$.
    \item Filaments possess intrinsic tension and vibrational dynamics.
    \item No external fields or forces are postulated; all interactions and particle properties emerge from filament geometry and topology.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Definitions}

\textbf{Filament}:
A smooth, one-dimensional object $\gamma : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ parameterized by an affine parameter $\lambda$.

\textbf{Worldtube}:
The 4D volume swept out by the vibrating filament, representing its real, physical presence in spacetime.

\textbf{Hyperhelix}:
A vibrational mode of a filament in 4D spacetime, characterized by helical motion in three spatial dimensions while progressing forward in time:
\[
\gamma^\mu(\lambda) = \left( \lambda, A_x \sin(k_x \lambda + \phi_x), A_y \sin(k_y \lambda + \phi_y), A_z \sin(k_z \lambda + \phi_z) \right)
\]
where $\lambda$ is an affine parameter along the filament, $A_i$ are amplitudes, $k_i$ are wavenumbers, and $\phi_i$ are phase shifts for $i \in \{x, y, z\}$.

\textbf{Tangent Vector}:
The 4-velocity of the filament is:
\[
v^\mu(\lambda) = \frac{d \gamma^\mu}{d \lambda}
\]

\textbf{Phase}:
The internal geometric property of the filament vibration, determined by the $\phi_i$ in each transverse direction. Phase governs interlocking and binding behavior.

\subsection*{Action Principle}

The action $S$ for a filament $\gamma$ is given by:
\[
S[\gamma] = \int d\lambda \, L(\gamma^\mu, v^\mu)
\]
with Lagrangian:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} m v^\mu v_\mu - V_{\text{tension}}(\gamma)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m$ is the filament tension mass-equivalent parameter.
    \item $v^\mu v_\mu$ is the Minkowski-normed kinetic term.
    \item $V_{\text{tension}}$ is a potential energy term arising from filament tension, dependent on the filament's geometric configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase-Locking and Binding Conditions}

\textbf{Phase-Locking Condition}:
Two or more filaments can enter a phase-locked configuration if their relative phase differences satisfy:
\[
\phi_i - \phi_j = \frac{2\pi k}{n}
\]
for integers $k$, $n$.

\textbf{Topological Stability Condition}:
Phase-locking is necessary but not sufficient. For \textbf{stable binding}, the filaments must form topologically nontrivial interlocks in 4D spacetime:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hopf Link}: Stable 2-filament configuration, corresponding to mesons.
    \item \textbf{Borromean Link}: Stable 3-filament configuration, corresponding to baryons.
    \item No stable topological interlocks exist for 4 or more filaments in 4D; higher-order configurations are geometrically allowed but topologically unstable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Physical Interpretation}

Filaments are \textbf{real, 1D physical objects} in 4D spacetime. Their vibrational hyperhelical structures are not passive traces but active, dynamic paths. Stable particles correspond to topologically locked phase-locked bundles of filaments.

\subsection*{Concluding Remarks}

This module establishes the \textbf{native 4D geometric basis} for filament dynamics in SAT\_O, grounding particle formation in real, topologically stable, hyperhelical vibrational structures without requiring external field constructs.
