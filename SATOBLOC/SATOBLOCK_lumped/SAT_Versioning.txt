Scalar-Angular Theory: Versioning and Modules
Source guide
This document meticulously catalogs the versioning and modular architecture of the Scalar‚ÄìAngular Theory (SAT), often referred to as the Scalar‚ÄìAngular Torsion Theory. It clearly distinguishes between the theory's formal historical versions and its internal organizational concepts, excluding meta-theoretical elements like workflow Phases or Interpretive Modes. The structure organizes the theory‚Äôs evolution into four distinct stages: a conceptual proto-theory stage, a transitional period using sequential numerical or Roman numeral labels like SAT 2.0 or SAT II, and the current Core Modular Framework identified by SAT O and SAT 4D. Crucially, the final section details the specific, numbered Internal Architectural Modules (e.g., SAT.O1, SAT.O3) that comprise the theory's structural components, covering diverse topics from hyperhelical filament dynamics to topological mass suppression and the derivation of gauge symmetries.











Scalar-Angular Theory: Versioning and Modules
This analysis adopts your strict convention for cataloging the formal theory versions and internal architectural components of the Scalar‚ÄìAngular Theory (SAT) [Query]. Accordingly, meta-theoretical concepts such as workflow Phases (I‚ÄìIX), Interpretive Modes (True Block, Semi-Dynamic), and specific cosmological interpretations like PGCU are excluded, as they represent the "gears and habits" of theory maintenance rather than its historical versioning or core modular architecture [Query].
The official name of the theory is Scalar‚ÄìAngular Theory or Scalar‚ÄìAngular Torsion Theory [Query, 105, 113, 118, 294, 297, 302, 496, 499, 570, 595].

Compiled SAT Versioning Structure
I. Conceptual and Proto-Theory Stage (Pre-Formalization)
This stage includes the origins and experimental organizational labels used before the theory adopted the explicit numerical modular framework.
Version Label
Context and Source Basis
Moleskin Sketches
The earliest, unnamed conceptual versions [Query].
Filament Hypothesis
Structured hypotheses developed when the term "filament" was introduced (c. 2022) [Query].
Stringing-Along Theory
The joking nickname that originally led to the SAT acronym [Query].
Chronophysical Structure
An alternate name proposed during early formalization [Query].
Module A, Module B, Module 0A, Module 0B
Recalled or hypothesized earliest module formats [Query].
II. Numbered, Roman, and Transitional Versions
These were explicit, standalone versions of the overall theory used sequentially throughout development.
Version Label
Context and Source Basis
SAT 2.0
The first explicit "new version" [Query, 93, 414, 464, 484]. The theory document refers to elements within the framework as SAT O 2.0 [1-3].
SAT 2.5
An intermediate numerical version [Query].
SAT II, SAT III.5, SAT V.5
Versions using Roman numeral conventions [Query].
SAT 20
A formal version variant that constructed geometry and gauge structures from minimal assumptions [Query, 414, 557, 558].
SAT X
An arbitrary sequence label adopted when the precise version count was lost; not strictly an experimental version [Query, 235].
SAT XY, SAT Y
Arbitrary sequential labels [Query].
SAT Next, SAT Edge
Descriptive transitional versions [Query].
SAT Rev
A referenced placeholder label [Query].
III. Core Modular Framework (SAT O and SAT 4D)
SAT O is the core version variant encompassing the development philosophy and initial set of foundational modules. SAT 4D refers to the architecture's commitment to a strictly 4D-native geometric framework [Query, 3, 4, 34, 420, 453, 477].
Version/Build Label
Context and Source Basis
SAT O
The collective name for the previous variant of the theory, encompassing the modules SAT.O0 onward [Query, 33, 439, 447, 559]. The theory operates within the SAT O Glossary definition standard [4, 5].
SAT 4D
The fundamental framework built on the necessity of a four-dimensional architecture [Query, 86, 418, 453, 477].
SATO 4D
A common synonym or project name for the current coherent development [6-12].
SAT Blockwave
The current build designation [Query, 568].
ST
Shorthand for String Theory when treated as geometric constraints within SAT 4D [13, 14].
IV. Internal Architectural Modules and Derivations
These labels designate specific, definitional components of the theory's structure, organized hierarchically under the SAT O umbrella. They are not independent versions of the theory, but modules within it [Query].

These documents outline the Scalar‚ÄìAngular‚ÄìTorsion (SAT) framework, a theoretical physics model proposing that all physical phenomena, including gravity, quantum mechanics, and the Standard Model, emerge from the topology and geometry of one-dimensional "filaments" embedded in a static, four-dimensional manifold called the Zottenwelt. Observable dynamics arise when a propagating time surface ($\Sigma_t$) intersects these filaments, where particle properties like mass and charge are determined by topological invariants such as linking and winding numbers ($Q$). The theory provides quantitative constraints on cosmological coupling using observational data (like CMB and INTEGRAL results) and defines how particle masses are suppressed by topological complexity ($Q$), with stability limited to bundles of three or fewer filaments. Furthermore, SAT reinterprets phenomena like Hawking radiation as topological reconnections and derives emergent gauge symmetries and the metric from filament statistics, aiming to be a fully self-consistent and testable framework with no imposed fields or extra dimensions.
