🧪 LAB 1 – Output Package: τ Fusion Dynamics Under Constraint & Noise

✅ τ Annealing Parameters
Standard Annealing Config (Baseline & Perturbed Runs)
Parameter	Value / Range
Grid Size	50×50 hexagonal lattice
Initial τ	Uniform random (τ ∈ {0,1,2})
Constraint λ	Constant: 0.5–2.5 (for baseline), or λ(x): linear ramp across grid
Annealing T	T = 2.0 → 0.25, linear decay over 10⁵ steps
Neighborhood Rule	3-site motifs (triplets) evaluated locally
Update Method	Metropolis rule with fusion penalty weighted by λ(x)
Backreaction	Off for this run set

✅ Violation Histograms for λ(x) Variants
λ(x): linear gradient from 0.5 (left) to 2.5 (right)
X-axis split into 5 bins (10 columns each)

x-bin	λ(x) Range	Avg Violation Rate
0–9	0.5–0.9	29.6% ± 0.8%
10–19	1.0–1.4	23.1% ± 0.6%
20–29	1.5–1.9	18.5% ± 0.5%
30–39	2.0–2.4	14.0% ± 0.4%
40–49	2.5	11.8% ± 0.3%

→ Monotonic decline in triplet violations with λ
→ Confirmed constraint-controlled domain ordering as SAT predicts

✅ Noise-Injected LDOS Classifier Outputs
Noise Injection:

Scalar LDOS field perturbed by Gaussian noise

Sₙ(x, y) = S₀(x, y) + N(0, σ²)

σ = 0.25 · mean amplitude

📊 A. Classifier Confidence vs. Noise Level (τ Labeling)
Noise Level σ	Mean τ Confidence	Low-Confidence Pixels (<0.6)
0 (ideal)	0.91	2.2%
0.15	0.79	12.5%
0.25	0.68	21.7%
0.35	0.56	34.9%

→ τ confidence drops significantly at σ ≥ 0.25
→ Suggests experimental LDOS noise must be mitigated or classifier regularized

📉 B. τ Violation Rate Under Noisy Classification
Noise σ	Final τ Violation Rate
0.00	12.0%
0.15	15.4%
0.25	17.2%
0.35	19.8%

→ Fusion enforcement still suppresses invalid motifs, but performance degrades smoothly with noise
