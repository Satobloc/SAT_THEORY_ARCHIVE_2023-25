4. Derived Predictions
Mass Emergence: from domain wall tension, quantized via τ fusion

Optical Birefringence Anomalies: Δn modulated by sin²θ₄ stacking

Phase Drift in Atmosphere: θ₄ turbulence predicts polarization lags near storm limbs

Geophysical Rupture Geometry: preferred angular separation ≈ 120° emerges from τ fusion logic

Time Curvature: effective gravitational behavior arises from wavefront strain and misalignment
