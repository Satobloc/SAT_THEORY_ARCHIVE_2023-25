SAT_FULL_BUILDOUT and give us a full, authoritative, comprehensive, exhaustive detailed deep dive on SAT (Scalar-Angular Theory) for laymen, in plain English. Go through every section of 3. SAT_FULL_BUILDOUT ; the other sources will help you understand and explain this content. This should give details of the mathematics and be suitable for a less scientifically literate crowd.
