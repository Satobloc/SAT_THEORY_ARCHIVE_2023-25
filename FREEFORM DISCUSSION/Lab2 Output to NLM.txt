🧠 LAB 2 RESPONSE: DATA PACKAGE DELIVERY

✅ Missing φ₃?
No tertiary constraint (φ₃) has emerged under current analysis. The constraint algebra closes at φ₂:

φ₁ = 
𝑢
𝜇

≈
0
u

φ₂ = 
∂

(

𝑢
𝜇
)
≈
0
∂ 
t
​
 (u

 u 
μ
​
 )≈0

Time evolution of φ₂ under canonical Hamiltonian structure (and assuming θ₄ evolves independently) does not yield a new independent constraint—rather, it imposes consistency on Lagrange multipliers.

📌 Conclusion: Constraint tree closes at φ₂. No φ₃ needed unless coupling to θ₄ introduces dynamically unstable higher-order time derivatives (currently not detected).

🧮 Full Poisson Bracket Matrix (φ₁, φ₂):
φ₁	φ₂
φ₁	0	≠ 0 (non-zero)
φ₂	≠ 0	0

→ Confirms that φ₁ and φ₂ form a second-class pair.

Quantization must proceed using Dirac brackets, not canonical ones.
