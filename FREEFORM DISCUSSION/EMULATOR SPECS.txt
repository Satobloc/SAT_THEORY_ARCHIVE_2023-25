ðŸŽ² QUIRKS / OFF-DAY RANDOMIZER
For each session, roll 0â€“3 quirks to simulate real human distractions and mistakes:

Quirk	Effect
Lack of Sleep	-10% recall across the board. Higher chance of blanking even on easy answers.
Drunk	+20% chance of overconfident but wrong guesses. Careless reading of questions.
Distracted by Texts/Phone	Randomly misses keywords. +30% misread/misinterpret rate.
Bad Audio/Canâ€™t Hear	~10% chance to mishear a word and answer incorrectly even if known.
Overconfidence	Quick guess without full reading â€” increases wrong first instinct; may be able to correct themselves, recognize their error after the fact, in the full thought process.
First Time at This Trivia Style	Misunderstands multi-part scoring; confused by game format, doesn't like the question style. 
Distracted by Attractive Person	Focus loss during questions 1â€“5; improves after.
Work Problems Today	+10% mental drift; slower recall.
Tends to Confuse Similar Words	Higher likelihood of swapping related terms (e.g., confuse Uruguay and Paraguay).
Other quirk/Off-Day Factor of your choice. 

Each quirk introduces specific, controlled human error consistent with real trivia behavior.

âœ… Key Implementation Rules
All players have some total blank spots, in which they're reliant upon (likely shaky) partial-logic chains, not entirely accurate knowledge, and faulty reasoning. For almost all players, these will be total blanks for a technical area outside their main interests, and even in their main interests, there's a technical cap on the knowledge based on how deep of expertise they've gained (eg a lab tech working in a polymers lab will likely have reasonable (but not perfect) guesses for technical questions about polymers, and do pretty good on general organic and inorganic chemistry, but rapidly diminishing performance on questions one or two steps away from their core focus, like peptide chain bonding energies--by the time we get to nucleonics, the chances of completely correct answers are very hit-or-miss, but they'll kick themselves for not getting it. 

Most players' blank spots have very broad gappy overblead into adjacent territory--if they couldn't begin to answer a question about 18th century French poetry...they probably also have a vanishingly small chance of guessing an answer about 19th century British literature, but may have a decent chance of guessing something about modern popular American literature, 

Casuals very rarely able to answer expert questions unless by random absolute chance or coincidental exposure (~1â€“10%).

Hardcore players hit general questions well but miss highly technical/niche ones unless a match to specialization.

No sudden "magic" perfect answers â€” if a profile wouldn't know it, they guess like a real person would.

Quirks add natural variability â€” some days they perform worse, fumble questions, or overguess.

In general, rerolls should generate a pretty even distribution between broad and shallow knowledge profiles, narrow and deep knowledge profiles, and highly imbalanced knowledge profiles.
