Here’s your SAT Developmental Debug Sheet, compact and actionable, integrating the Brain Trust’s endorsement and hardline critique:

🛠 SAT vNext Developmental Checklist
Version: 0.1.1 — “From Metaphor to Machinery”
Issued by: Active Edge vNext
Authorized by: Wavefront Brain Trust
Use Case: Weekly review, development prioritization, task delegation

I. 🔧 Structural Fixes (Hard Requirements)
Issue	Fix	Status
❗ Incomplete constraint closure	Complete Dirac–Bergmann analysis; build full Poisson matrix and classify φ₁, φ₂, φ₃…	🔜
❗ uᵘ ambiguity	Choose and justify: dynamical, background, or emergent	⚠ Unresolved
❗ τ lacks formal dynamics	Lift τ from static labels to full lattice field theory (e.g., Dijkgraaf–Witten, cohomology class)	⏳ Design pending
❗ No stress-energy tensor	Derive Tᵘᵛ from Noether method (at least for θ₄, then uᵘ)	⏳ To be assigned
❗ Kink stability untested	Analyze perturbation modes, compute kink tension, identify conserved charges	🔜 Required for matter analog claims
❗ No gauge structure	Investigate emergent U(1), SU(3) or Chern-Simons-like behavior in τ/θ₄ composite space	🧪 Exploratory
❗ No falsifiability thresholds	Define ≥2 predictive observables with fail conditions (e.g., “Δφ ≥ X under condition Y”)	🛠️ Needed before next sim run

II. 🔭 Simulation / Experiment Targets (Near-Term)
Target	Description	Status
✅ θ₄ kink → Δφ fringe compression	Published sim shows ~0.25 rad phase shift	✔ Confirmed
✅ τ exclusion vs λ(x) gradient	Shows suppression of invalid motifs with increased fusion strength	✔ Confirmed
⏳ Radial θ₄ kink interferometry	Full image + Δφ(r) curve simulated; ready for publication overlay	🔜 Compose paper
⏳ θ₄–τ co-dynamics toy model	Shows mutual locking of curvature and fusion topology	⚠️ Extend to 2D
⏳ Martian limb polarization	Build SAT-compatible radiative transfer sim (θ₄ gradient → scattering anisotropy)	🔜 Begin bin setup

III. 🧠 Theory Expansion (Strategic Priority)
Topic	Goal	Lead
Composite excitation algebra	Map θ₄–τ defects to fermion-like behavior (spin, statistics, exclusion)	Lab 2
Constraint gauge fixing	Test different foliations (synchronous, ADM-like, emergent slicing)	vNext
EFT development	Flowchart from SAT → low-energy excitations; define coupling constants	Lab 2 / Theorizer Emeritus
τ–θ₄ dynamic coupling	Elevate τ = round(3θ₄/2π) from diagnostic to energy-coupled term	Lab 1
Field mapping refinement	Align IR signatures (mass, charge, spin) with SAT excitations	vNext

IV. 🚦 Gate Criteria for Quantum SAT Launch
SAT is not ready for quantum field formulation unless the following are met:

 Full constraint closure with classified second-class structure

 Hamiltonian defined in terms of proper Dirac brackets

 τ promoted to path-integrable variable or cochain

 uᵘ status resolved and stress-energy consistently derivable

If all pass, proceed to EFT matching and initial path integral construction.

V. 🧬 Language Rules & Commitments
✔ SAT may no longer be described solely metaphorically.

✔ Terms like "particle," "defect," and "matter" are only used where composite excitation analysis supports it.

✔ All field definitions must be tied to testable behavior, either via simulation or known analogs.

✔ Anomalies are pursued only if SAT predicts them before they are explained by other means.
