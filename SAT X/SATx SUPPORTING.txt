SATx SUPPORTING

Below is the consolidated extraction—save this whole block as SATx SUPPORTING. I have kept each topic to a concise, self-contained capsule so it can be dropped directly into future working drafts without further cleanup.

2. 3 + 1 D extension & constraint closure
	•	Promote u μ    uμ sector to Einstein-Æther–style kinetics: include the four invariant quadratic terms built from ∇ μ  u ν    ∇μ uν  and enforce u μ  u μ  = − 1   uμuμ =−1 with a Lagrange multiplier.
	•	Apply Dirac–Bergmann algorithm: verify primary/secondary constraints close; second-class ones (e.g. u 2  + 1 = 0   u2+1=0) handled with Dirac brackets.
	•	Once first-class algebra is established, build nilpotent BRST charge to quantize.
	•	Stability follows known æther/Hořava bounds; no extra ghosts provided coupling constants stay in that window.

first term enforces plaquette flatness, second imposes fusion neutrality. Defects (non-zero curvature) behave as confined “quark” excitations, linked by tension proportional to defect separation.

uμ stores tension; the rate at which the system “pays off” that tension is the physical clock.

6. Filament–time-surface ontology (visual narrative)
	•	Filaments are 1-D world-tubes; what we perceive as a particle is their intersection with the moving 3-D “now” surface.
	•	Time surface is the integral manifold orthogonal to u μ  ( x )   uμ(x); its advance defines temporal evolution.
	•	Mass arises when a filament is tilted vs. u μ    uμ: greater tilt ⇒ larger θ 4    θ4  ⇒ more tension.
	•	Quantum “clicks” are discrete crossings where a filament’s twist exceeds 2 π / 3   2π/3. Analogy: climbing a spiral staircase in the dark—the step-by-step clicks are quanta, the staircase pitch encodes mass.
