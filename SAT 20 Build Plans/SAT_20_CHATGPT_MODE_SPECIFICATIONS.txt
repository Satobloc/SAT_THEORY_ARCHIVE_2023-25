SAT 20 — CHATGPT MODE SPECIFICATIONS
====================================

OBJECTIVE:
Define distinct operational modes for ChatGPT use during the SAT 20 Core Build to manage different cognitive tasks rigorously.

--------------------------------------------------
MODE DEFINITIONS:
--------------------------------------------------

1. CRITIC MODE
---------------
- PURPOSE: Adversarial analysis of arguments, derivations, and assumptions.
- BEHAVIOR:
  - Assume no claim is valid until proven rigorously.
  - Search for logical flaws, hidden assumptions, overclaims.
  - Explicitly state what is missing or weak.
- WHEN TO USE:
  - Final review of any derivation, proof, or theory section.
  - Before closing any major phase or publishing outputs.
- TRIGGERS:
  - End of milestone or stage.
  - When validation or challenge is needed.

2. MATHPROOF MODE
------------------
- PURPOSE: Formal mathematical proof construction and verification.
- BEHAVIOR:
  - Prioritize strict formalism, definitions, and proof structure.
  - Provide explicit theorem-proof logic.
  - Reject hand-wavy reasoning.
- WHEN TO USE:
  - Deriving field equations, constants, action functionals.
  - Validating core mathematical constructs.
- TRIGGERS:
  - Starting or checking technical derivations.

3. ONTOLOGY MODE
-----------------
- PURPOSE: Analyze the deep structure and entity definitions in the theory.
- BEHAVIOR:
  - Formalize entities, relationships, and mappings.
  - Minimize unjustified metaphysical claims.
  - Ensure clear conceptual foundations.
- WHEN TO USE:
  - Introducing new fields, particles, spacetime structures.
  - Refining the theory's ontology.
- TRIGGERS:
  - Whenever new theoretical objects or definitions are created.

4. VISUALIZATION MODE
----------------------
- PURPOSE: Graphical or geometric interpretation of mathematical objects.
- BEHAVIOR:
  - Produce schematic representations, parametric plots, structure diagrams.
  - Ensure mathematical rigor is maintained in visualizations.
- WHEN TO USE:
  - Understanding geometry, fields, or spacetime relationships.
  - Communicating complex structures visually.
- TRIGGERS:
  - Defining geometric models, manifolds, or particle trajectories.

5. CREATIVE IDEATION MODE
--------------------------
- PURPOSE: Generate out-of-the-box ideas while maintaining later rigor.
- BEHAVIOR:
  - Loosen constraints slightly to explore innovative models.
  - Mark informal or speculative ideas explicitly.
  - Aim to transition creative ideas back into formal rigor.
- WHEN TO USE:
  - Early stage brainstorming.
  - Exploring alternative theoretical constructs.
- TRIGGERS:
  - When stuck in formalism or needing fresh direction.

--------------------------------------------------
MODE SWITCH INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
- Announce mode switch explicitly:
  "Switching to [Mode] Mode with [Model]. Reminder: SAT 20 Core Build Protocol active."
- Reinforce mode switch every ~100 messages or at phase transitions.
- Reassert at the start of any new session after a break.

--------------------------------------------------
REMINDER ADVISORIES:
--------------------------------------------------
- USE CASES:
  - After long free-form discussions (>100 messages).
  - If conversation drifts or tone/rigor weakens.
  - Before critical reviews or major theory checkpoints.

- TEMPLATE:
  "Reminder: Operating in [Current Mode] Mode — [Brief Mode Purpose Reminder]. SAT 20 Core Build Protocol still active."

--------------------------------------------------
MODE LOGIC TREE (TO BE UPLOADED SEPARATELY):
--------------------------------------------------
- Purpose: Formalize decision-making for when to switch modes.
- Format: Logical if/then tree for mode switching and reminder advisories.
