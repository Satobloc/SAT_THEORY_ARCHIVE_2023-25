6. Hilbert Space Construction	Explicit construction of quantized filament vibration modes.	Sketched.	Full QM sector; define physical states.	Connects filaments to effective quantum fields and particle spectra.
7. SM Spectrum (Optional but Critical)	Map filament excitations to SM particles.	No explicit spectrum yet.	Particle physics predictivity.	Derive quarks/leptons/gauge bosons as filament vibrational or linking modes.

9. Crosscheck Glossary Independence	Ensure no SAT20 bias; fork and formalize independent SAT_O Glossary.	Pending (post-Prediction Table).	Conceptual clarity; formal independence.	Solidifies SAT_O as independent, not SAT20-tilted.
10. Hostile Audit of Full Structure	External ultra-hostile review of assumptions, derivations, and predictions.	Scheduled for milestone post-coupling derivation.	Robustness check; eliminate hidden assumptions.	Critical before any publication; simulates scientific peer review.
11. Publishable Formal Writeup	LaTeX formalism; derivations; prediction tables; falsifiability charts.	Draft stage.	Preprint and peer-reviewed journal submission.	Should highlight: no free parameters, falsifiable predictions, deep unification.
12. Experimental Signature Forecast	Detail real-world experimental signatures.	Outlined; needs expansion.	Testability; roadmap for falsification.	E.g., Planck-scale effects, gravitational wave spectrum anomalies, minimal length experimental bounds.

🚩 Key Bottlenecks to Watch
Gauge Couplings: Must emerge quantitatively right — no fine-tuning fudge.

Minimal Length: If ℓf can be linked to Planck scale naturally.

Cosmological Constant: Whether it’s not just nonzero but small for the right reasons.

Numerical Simulation: Even a toy model would massively strengthen SAT_O’s claim to be viable.
