Immediate Critical Questions
Statistical Filament Models:

Can 
𝜌

ρ

 , 
𝜌
link
ρ 
link
​
 , and 
𝜌
triple link
ρ

​
  be calculated from first principles?

Do they match observed SM coupling ratios without fine-tuning?

Running of Couplings:

Is there a mechanism by which filament topology scales with energy scale → mimic renormalization group running of gauge couplings?

Gravitational Higher Order Corrections:

How large are the 
𝑂
(
𝑅
2
)
O(R 
2
 ) terms?

Could they lead to testable deviations from GR (e.g., in gravitational waves, black holes, early universe)?

Vacuum Stability:

Is 
Λ
induced
Λ 
induced
​
  stable under filament ensemble fluctuations?

Could filament topologies dynamically explain the small but nonzero cosmological constant?
