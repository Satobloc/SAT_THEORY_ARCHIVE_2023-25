Originally, at the live event, some categories had visual elements (e.g., pictures of piercings, old band names/photos, audio clips for cartoons in Round 4).

Are you sure it wasn’t Leif Erickson?
ChatGPT said:
Good question! Let’s double-check:

Leif Erikson was indeed a famous Norse explorer — he’s credited with reaching North America (Vinland) around 1000 AD.

Erik the Red, Leif’s father, was the one who founded the first Norse settlements in Greenland.

According to the Icelandic sagas, Erik the Red named Greenland strategically — to make it sound more appealing and encourage settlers, even though it was much icier and less green than the name suggests.

✅ Verdict: Erik the Red is the correct answer for the Greenland real estate "scam," not Leif Erikson.
