Perfect. Developing a clear, consistent visual vocabulary is essential—not just for communication, but for reasoning. You’re building a visual-first theory, so your diagrammatic language is your symbolic language.

Let’s begin by introducing basic visual forms to represent:

The wavefront (time propagation)

Filaments (with angular variation)

Intersection behaviors (massless, massive, rippling)

Composite structures (threads, braids, entangled states)

SAT-W Visual Vocabulary: Foundational Elements
🔹 1. The Time Wavefront
Representation:
A moving curved surface, often drawn as a 2D slice of a spherical or curved front. This surface is not a substance—it's a moving cross-section of reality.


Symbol	Description
◯ expanding arc	Local 2D slice of the 3D time surface
→ normal vector	Direction of time propagation
Lines perpendicular to arc	Represent "now" in SAT-W terms
Note: For early-universe scenarios, the curvature is high (wavefront is very convex); at late times, the wavefront becomes flatter.

🔹 2. Filaments
Representation:
Straight or curved lines that pierce the wavefront, extending in four dimensions. Their angle relative to the wavefront encodes behavior.


Orientation	Meaning
↕ perpendicular to wavefront	No drag → massless (photon-like)
／ angled	Drag → massive
~ sinusoidal / helical	Oscillation, twist → resonance, possible internal structure
≈ parallel filaments	Empty space or spatial field, carries ripples
🔹 3. Particle Intersections
Representation:
Where filaments intersect the wavefront, draw a dot or highlight to indicate observable manifestation (a “particle” event). The angle defines the energy transfer.


Diagram	Meaning
● on angled filament	Mass-bearing particle
○ on vertical filament	Massless (e.g. photon intersection)
∼∼ between filaments	Ripple (photon/gluon/W/Z) transferring structure between filaments
Add drag field lines or radial vectors to represent the intensity of angular deviation and thus the energy transfer.

🔹 4. Composite Structures
You can represent different hierarchical filament bundles using increasingly thick or textured lines:


Name	Visual Element	Meaning
Thread	3 closely twisted lines	Mesons, baryons (proton/neutron)
Twine	Bundle of threads	Atom-like
Yarn	Multi-twine braid	Molecule-like
Bundle	Complex 4D knotwork	Macroscopic object (e.g. rock, organism)
Entanglement:

Cross-thread long-distance coherence = quantum entanglement

Looping or repeated filament contacts across time = memory, feedback, possibly conscious experience

🔧 Draft Conventions (Symbols)

Symbol	Concept
◯	Time wavefront slice
/, \	Angled filaments = matter
~	Wavy filament = vibration / oscillation
∼∼	Ripple transfer (e.g. photon)
●	Particle intersection
✳	High-drag “mass node”
🔁	Filament loop or feedback
↯	Tension source or release (e.g. decay, transition)
Would you like me to generate a few sample diagrams next?
