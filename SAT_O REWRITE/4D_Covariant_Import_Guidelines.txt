4D COVARIANT IMPORT GUIDELINES

Objective:
----------
Import standard physics theories in their fully covariant 4D formulations, formatted for compatibility with the SAT_O framework. 

Scope:
------
Theories to Import:
- General Relativity (GR): Einstein Field Equations, Riemann, Ricci, Bianchi identities.
- Electromagnetism: Maxwell's equations (tensor form), Lagrangian density.
- Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): Covariant Dirac equation, gauge interactions.
- Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): Non-Abelian gauge theory, Yang-Mills Lagrangian.
- Yang-Mills Theory: SU(N) gauge groups in 4D.
- Classical Field Theory: Scalar fields (Klein-Gordon).

Guidelines:
-----------
1. Full 4D Covariant Form Only.
2. No Background Assumptions: Avoid assuming flat space or static backgrounds.
3. No Gauge Fixing: General covariant form without assuming particular gauges.
4. Explicit Tensor Structure: Show all indices, no compacted notation.
5. Operational Definitions: Provide physically measurable interpretations.
6. Geometric Interpretation: Describe geometric meaning (e.g., curvature).
7. Separation of Laws and Solutions: Provide laws, not specific solutions.
8. Rank Discipline: Track tensor ranks explicitly (no shortcuts).

Delivery Format:
----------------
- Clean 4D Tensor Equations.
- Brief Geometric Interpretation.
- List of Tensors and Their Ranks.
- Operational Interpretations.

Watch-Outs:
-----------
- No 3D+1 decompositions unless necessary.
- Avoid hidden gauge fixing.
- Strip background assumptions.
- No compressed or obscured notation.
