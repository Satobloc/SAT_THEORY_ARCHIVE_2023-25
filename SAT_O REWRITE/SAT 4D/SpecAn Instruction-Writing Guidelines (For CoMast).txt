Instructions for SATCoMast When Creating SecAn Tasks
Whenever a subproblem appears that cannot be resolved cleanly under all official SAT directives (or whose resolution might benefit from relaxed conditions), initiate a SecAn instance using the template above.

Steps:
Define the Problem Clearly

Narrow the task to a single issue or structural gap.

If the problem stems from a critique, include the critique excerpt.

Review Which Official Directives Apply or parts of official directives and other operating procedures to modify (eg Does this task require relaxing block-universe assumptions? Do we specify interpretive mode 1, 2, 3? Must solutions be falsifiable, or is a conceptual scaffold sufficient?)

Declare the Directive Inheritance

Fill out which portions of Directives Oneâ€“Three are enforced, relaxed, or suspended.

Choose the interpretive mode(s), etc that the SecAn may/must/musn't/shouldn't use.

Specify the Output Format

Formal proof sketch? Patch candidate? Countermodel? Visualization?

Log the Task and Dispatch

Assign it an ID (e.g., SecAn-C5.1-TopLinkingPatch)

Issue the request.

Upon return, review the output, and assign one of the three disposition statuses.
