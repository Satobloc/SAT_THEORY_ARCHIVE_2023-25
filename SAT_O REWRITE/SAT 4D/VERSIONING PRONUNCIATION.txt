The full pronunciation guide is to come, but for the purposes of the “about this podcast” episode, the following should suffice.
SAT — pronounced “essay-tea”
SAT-Z — pronounced “essay-tea ZEE”
SAT-4D — pronounced “essay-tea four dee”
SAT-Z — pronounced “essay-tea ZEE”
SAT-YZ — pronounced “essay-tea WHY ZEE”
SAT-III — pronounced “essay-tea THREE”
SAT-V — pronounced “essay-tea FIVE”
If reading any text that contains LaTeX markup (which looks like this: “\texttt{SAT\subscript{4D}}” or similar), try to just read the text within the curly brackets, and try to leave out the \ commands and the brackets themselves. For the given example, “ \texttt{SAT.4D\subscript{4D}}” is just SAT 4D, pronounced as above, “essay-tee four dee”. If there’s any doubt, just refer to the theory as “essay-tee”, ignoring appended versioning qualifiers. You should really only need to refer to the versioning on the way occasion where you actually need to talk about things that have changed from version to version.
