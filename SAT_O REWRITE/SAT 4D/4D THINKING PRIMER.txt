\section*{Introduction}

Human intuition is fundamentally three-dimensional. Our sensory and cognitive structures are adapted to 3D space and 1D time. Yet, nature presents itself as fundamentally four-dimensional: spacetime is not 3D evolving in time — it is \textbf{fully 4D from the start}.

To theorize rigorously in 4D requires a conceptual shift:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Objects are extended in time as well as in space.
    \item Dynamics are replaced by 4D geometry.
    \item Motion is interpreted as structure.
    \item Stability and binding arise from topological constraints.
\end{itemize}

This primer outlines the core rules and mindset shifts necessary to think and theorize natively in 4D.

\section*{1. 4D Objects: Worldtubes, Not Worldlines}

\textbf{Rule 1}: 
\begin{quote}
A 4D object is not something that ``exists over time.'' It \textit{is} its 4D extension — a worldtube, not a point tracing a worldline.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Rule 2}:
\begin{quote}
Everything you think of as an ``event'' is a cross-section of a 4D object.
\end{quote}

Particles are not points moving through space; they are extended 4D structures whose ``states'' at a given time are slices through their worldtubes.

\section*{2. Vibrations and Dynamics in 4D}

\textbf{Rule 3}:
\begin{quote}
Dynamics are just 4D shapes, not processes. A wave is a 4D spiral.
\end{quote}

A vibrating filament is a hyperhelical 4D object. Its vibration is encoded in its 4D geometry — not as motion over time, but as a built-in coiled structure.

\section*{3. Topology Over Geometry}

\textbf{Rule 4}:
\begin{quote}
In 4D, linking is more fundamental than shape.
\end{quote}

4D structures are constrained by topology:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linking}, \textbf{knotting}, \textbf{winding} — not just geometric shape — determine physical properties.
    \item Energy, mass, and binding emerge from topological strain.
\end{itemize}

\section*{4. Avoid 3D Intuition Traps}

\textbf{Rule 5}:
\begin{quote}
If you find yourself ``evolving'' something through time, you are slipping back into 3D intuition.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid thinking of particles as points evolving in time.
    \item Think of the full 4D form — the sculpture, not the movie.
\end{itemize}

\section*{5. Phase and Symmetry in 4D}

\textbf{Rule 6}:
\begin{quote}
Phase is a 4D angle — it defines orientation in 4D vibrational structures.
\end{quote}

Phase relations are geometric symmetries in 4D spacetime, governing the alignment and locking of filament bundles.

\section*{6. Mathematics: 4D Constructs Only}

\textbf{Rule 7}:
\begin{quote}
Your mathematics must be 4D-native from the start.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use 4-vectors, 4D manifolds.
    \item Treat time as an equal coordinate, not a separate parameter.
    \item Use 4D topology: Hopf links, Borromean rings, not 3D knots.
\end{itemize}

\section*{7. Physical Interpretation: What Are Objects?}

\textbf{Rule 8}:
\begin{quote}
Matter is geometry. Binding is topology. Mass is strain.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Particles are real 4D filament bundles.
    \item Vibrations are hyperhelical structures.
    \item Binding occurs via topological interlocking — not forces.
    \item Mass arises from topological strain — not intrinsic properties.
\end{itemize}

\section*{4D Thinking Checklist}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Am I thinking about full 4D objects, not evolving 3D things?
    \item Am I treating phase as geometric orientation, not timing?
    \item Am I prioritizing linking, winding, and knotting?
    \item Am I using 4D-native mathematics?
    \item Am I interpreting mass, binding, and stability as topological and geometric?
    \item Am I sculpting in 4D, not animating 3D movies?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Sharpest Summary}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{In 4D, matter is form. Binding is linking. Motion is geometry. Vibration is structure. Stability is topology. Mass is strain.}
