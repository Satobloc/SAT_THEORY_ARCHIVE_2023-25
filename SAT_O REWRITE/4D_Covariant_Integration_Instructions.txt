4D COVARIANT INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAT_O

Objective:
----------
Integrate imported covariant physics theories into the SAT_O framework while preserving its core geometric and emergent principles.

Fundamental Integration Principles:
------------------------------------
1. Geometry First, Dynamics Second: Analyze geometric content first.
2. Identify Structural Overlaps: Map imported structures to SAT_O constructs.
3. No Background Assumptions: Strip away implicit flat space or background metrics.
4. Emergence Compatibility: Reinterpret fundamental fields as emergent.
5. Tensor Discipline: Match tensor structures to SAT_O’s emergent forms.
6. Dimensional Consistency: Maintain strict 4D structure.
7. Operational Interoperability: Ensure observables match SAT_O operational constructs.
8. Emergent Quantum Fields: Gauge fields must emerge from topology.
9. Covariance Enforced: Maintain full covariance without fixed gauges.
10. No Overwrites: Imported theories are baselines — SAT_O constructs have priority.

Integration Process:
---------------------
1. Import the 4D Covariant Form.
2. Analyze Geometric Content.
3. Map Structures to SAT_O equivalents.
4. Strip Background Assumptions.
5. Define Operational Interpretation.
6. Document Mappings.
7. Flag Deviations.

Special Focus Areas:
---------------------
- GR: Metric and curvature must emerge from filament statistics.
- EM: Field strengths must map to filament twist/shear.
- Gauge Theories: SU(N) structures must emerge from topological linking.
- Quantum Fields: Spinor fields must derive from filament topology.

Outcome:
--------
- A fully integrated 4D physics reference library, aligned with SAT_O’s emergent framework.
