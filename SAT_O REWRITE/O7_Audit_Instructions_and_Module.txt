Preliminary Model of Time as Relational Sheen in a 4D Filamentary Spacetime

Abstract

We present a tentative model wherein the phenomenon of time arises not as a fundamental dimension, but as an emergent feature — a relational sheen — resulting from local drift in the configuration of filamentary structures in a four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Filaments, representing particle worldlines, generate a dynamic relational geometry whose local stress and strain patterns propagate without the need for material flow, creating an apparent passage of time.

1 Introduction

We consider a four-dimensional differentiable manifold M, initially without an imposed metric structure. The manifold is populated by a dense ensemble of filaments, each defined as a smooth embedding:

γ : R → M, λ ↦ γμ(λ), (1)

where λ is an affine parameter along the filament. The tangent vector to each filament is given by:

vμ(λ) = dγμ/dλ. (2)

2 Filament Congruence and Emergent Time

Define the local filament current:

Jμ(x) = ∑_γ ∫ dλ vμ(λ) δ⁽⁴⁾(x−γ(λ)), (3)

which encodes the local density and orientation of worldlines. We propose that a local time direction arises dynamically as:

τμ(x) ∝ Jμ(x), (4)

leading to a local scalar foliation field:

dφ(x) = τμ(x) dxμ. (5)

3 Relational Drift and the Sheen Scalar

Consider two neighboring filaments with separation vector:

δxμ(λ) = γμ₂(λ) − γμ₁(λ). (6)

Define the relational strain tensor:

Sμν(λ) = δxα(λ) ∇α v(μ vν), (7)

capturing the local misalignment and strain in the bundle of worldlines. Introduce the scalar sheen field:

S(x) = √(Sμν(x) Sμν(x)), (8)

which quantifies the magnitude of relational drift at each spacetime point.

4 Local Activation Rate and Time Flow

Define the local sheen activation rate:

ω(x) = dS(x)/dφ, (9)

interpreted as the local rate of relational shift relative to the emergent foliation. We tentatively propose that the proper time increment is given by:

dτ ∝ ω(x) dφ. (10)

Thus, the passage of time is associated with the evolving relational structure among worldlines.

5 Sheen Field Dynamics

As an initial hypothesis, we suggest that the sheen field satisfies a diffusion-like or wave-like equation:

□S(x) − V'(S(x)) = 0, (11)

where □ is the d'Alembertian operator with respect to the emergent metric, and V(S) is a potential governing the elasticity or resistance of relational drift.

6 Entropy and Time’s Arrow

Finally, we propose that the local entropy density s(x) is proportional to the relational strain:

s(x) ∝ S(x), (12)

implying that entropy production is inherently tied to the growth of the relational sheen:

ds/dτ ∝ ω(x). (13)

7 Conclusion

In this tentative framework, time is not a fundamental backdrop but an emergent, relational phenomenon — a dynamic sheen arising from the slow migration of filamentary alignments in four-dimensional spacetime. This model opens avenues for further mathematical development, possible observational signatures, and connections to thermodynamic and quantum structures.
