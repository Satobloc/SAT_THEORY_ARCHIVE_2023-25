,

Symmetry Axioms
S1. Fundamental Symmetries
S1.1: Foliation-preserving diffeomorphism invariance:
SAT is invariant under diffeomorphisms that preserve the foliation structure defined by 
𝑢
𝜇
(
𝑥
)
u 
μ
 (x). Formally:

𝑥
𝜇
→
𝑥
𝜇
′
(
𝑥
𝜈
)
with
𝐿
𝜉
𝑢
𝜇
=
0
,
x 
μ
 →x 
μ 
′
 
 (x 
ν
 )withL 
ξ
​
 u 
μ
 =0,
where 
𝐿
𝜉
L 
ξ
​
  is the Lie derivative along vector field 
𝜉
ξ.

S1.2: Internal 
𝑈
(
1
)
U(1) gauge symmetry:
The phase field 
𝜓
ψ is invariant under:

𝜓
(
𝑥
)
→
𝜓
(
𝑥
)
+
𝜒
(
𝑥
)
,
𝜒
(
𝑥
)
∈
𝑈
(
1
)
.
ψ(x)→ψ(x)+χ(x),χ(x)∈U(1).
S1.3: Topological Discreteness:
The twist field 
𝜏
τ obeys a discrete global symmetry:

𝜏
(
𝑥
)
→
𝜏
(
𝑥
)
+
𝑛
,
𝑛
∈
𝑍
3
,
τ(x)→τ(x)+n,n∈Z 
3
​
 ,
with no continuous deformation allowed between distinct 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  sectors.

S1.4: Gauge Invariance of Couplings:
Couplings involving 
𝜓
ψ must respect local 
𝑈
(
1
)
U(1) gauge invariance. All gauge fields must transform under standard gauge transformations:

𝐴
𝜇
(
𝑥
)
→
𝐴
𝜇
(
𝑥
)
+
∂
𝜇
𝜒
(
𝑥
)
.
A 
μ
​
 (x)→A 
μ
​
 (x)+∂ 
μ
​
 χ(x).
S1.5: Vacuum Stability and Lorentzian Signature:
The emergent metric 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
(
𝑥
)
g 
μν
​
 (x) must have Lorentzian signature 
(
−
+
+
+
)
(−+++) in the vacuum configuration, enforced by the functional form of 
𝑓
1
(
𝜃
4
)
f 
1
​
 (θ 
4
​
 ), 
𝑓
2
(
𝜃
4
)
f 
2
​
 (θ 
4
​
 ), and the ground state values of 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
  and 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 .

S2. Dynamical Assumptions
S2.1: Action Minimization Principle:
Dynamics are determined by extremization of a scalar action 
𝑆
S under variations of 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
 , 
𝜓
ψ, 
𝜏
τ, and 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 , subject to the normalization constraint on 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 .

S2.2: Minimal Derivative Order:
The action involves at most second derivatives of the fundamental fields, ensuring that field equations are second-order PDEs (no Ostrogradsky instabilities).

S2.3: Compactness of 
𝜓
ψ:
The phase field 
𝜓
ψ has strictly compact domain, implying quantization of conjugate momenta and the existence of a fundamental action scale 
ℏ
ℏ.

Summary: What is Assumed — and What is Not
Assumed:

Existence and normalization of 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 .

Periodicity and compactness of 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
  and 
𝜓
ψ.

Discreteness of 
𝜏
τ.

Foliation-preserving diffeomorphism invariance (not full spacetime diffeomorphism invariance).

Internal 
𝑈
(
1
)
U(1) gauge symmetry.

Lorentzian signature preservation in vacuum.

Not Assumed:

No prior metric structure — the metric is emergent.

No explicit curvature tensors or Christoffel symbols — derived from the emergent 
𝑔
𝜇
𝜈
g 
μν
​
 .

No explicit Planck units — 
ℏ
ℏ, 
𝑐
c, 
𝐺
G must emerge naturally.

No insertion of gravitational or gauge coupling constants — their emergence must be shown.
