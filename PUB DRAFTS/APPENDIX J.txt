Appendix J. Derivation of Charge Quantization
Proof
In the SAT framework, electric charge quantization arises as a direct consequence of the compactness of the internal phase field 
𝜓
ψ and its coupling to the emergent 
𝑈
(
1
)
U(1) gauge field.

Compactness of 
𝜓
ψ
The phase field 
𝜓
(
𝑥
)
ψ(x) is compact:

𝜓
(
𝑥
)
∼
𝜓
(
𝑥
)
+
2
𝜋
.
ψ(x)∼ψ(x)+2π.
Any physical state must be invariant under large gauge transformations:

𝜓
(
𝑥
)
→
𝜓
(
𝑥
)

𝑛

ψ(x)→ψ(x)+2πn,n∈Z.

Under a large gauge transformation:

(

+

𝜋
𝑛
,
ψ(x)→ψ(x)+2πn,
the action picks up a phase:

exp(iq∫A

Single-Valuedness of the Wavefunction
The wavefunction must be single-valued under large gauge transformations:

exp
⁡
(
𝑖
𝑞

)

exp(iq∮

Thus:

  defines the electromagnetic flux through the loop 
𝐶
C. For consistency:

𝑞
=
𝑛
𝑒
,
q=ne,
where 
𝑒
e is the elementary unit of charge corresponding to 
𝑛
=
1
n=1.

Thus, in SAT, all charges are integer multiples of the fundamental unit 
𝑒
e, and no fractional charges can arise without explicit topological defects or extensions to the compactification structure.

Empirically, the observed spectrum of electric charges is:

𝑞
=
𝑛
𝑒
,
𝑛

q=ne,n∈Z.
\boxed{ \text{SAT predicts electric charge quantization as an automatic consequence of } \psi\text{-compactness and gauge invariance. }
Why These Equations
Charge quantization in conventional quantum mechanics is an input; in SAT, it is an output.

The compact nature of 
𝜓
ψ enforces periodicity.

Gauge invariance under large transformations demands that physical observables, such as the Wilson loop 
exp
⁡
(
𝑖
𝑞
∮
𝐴
)
exp(iq∮A), be invariant.

This leads to a quantization condition on 
𝑞
q, independent of any additional assumptions.

Thus, charge quantization arises from the internal topology of SAT’s field configuration space and the requirement of wavefunction single-valuedness.
