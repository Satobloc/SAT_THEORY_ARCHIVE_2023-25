Appendix K. Derivation of Anomaly Cancellation
Proof
In quantum field theory, gauge anomalies arise when classical gauge symmetries fail to survive quantization. Anomaly cancellation is essential for the internal consistency and unitarity of a quantum field theory.

In the Standard Model, anomaly cancellation occurs due to the specific assignment of fermion representations under the gauge group

𝑈
(

)
×
𝑆
𝑈
(

)
×
𝑈
(

)
SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1).

In SAT, fermions are constructed as topological excitations in the 
𝜓
ψ-
𝜏
τ sector:

The 
𝜓
ψ field governs the 
𝑈
(
1
)
U(1) hypercharge structure.

The 
𝜏
τ field organizes particles into triplets under 
𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3) and doublets under 
𝑆
𝑈
(
2
)
SU(2).

Each excitation carries a set of quantum numbers corresponding to its winding number and sector label.

  cancel identically using the above hypercharge assignments.

Thus, SAT’s field and charge assignment structure inherently satisfies all anomaly cancellation conditions necessary for a consistent quantum field theory.

Why These Equations
The specific hypercharge assignments and group representations are not arbitrary. In SAT:

The 
𝜏
τ sector structures the matter fields into triplets and singlets under 
𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3).

The 
𝜓
ψ winding numbers determine hypercharges, constrained by topological consistency.

The independence of 
𝜏
τ and 
𝜓
ψ sectors ensures that each anomaly cancels within each generation, as in the Standard Model.

Anomaly cancellation is a strict requirement: failure to cancel would render the theory inconsistent. SAT’s geometric and topological assignments naturally satisfy these constraints without any need for fine-tuning.
