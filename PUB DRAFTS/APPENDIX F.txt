Proof
In the SAT framework, mass generation for fermions arises from the interaction between the phase field 
𝜓
ψ and the topological twist field 
𝜏
τ.

The internal phase 
𝜓
ψ defines a clock-like compact variable associated with internal time evolution, and the twist field 
𝜏
τ introduces a discrete 
𝑍

Z

​
  topological sector structure. The mass spectrum emerges from winding numbers and click-frequencies related to these fields.

The proposed mass law for leptons in SAT is:

𝑚
𝑛
=
𝑚
0
⋅
𝑛
(
𝑛
+
1
)
2
,
m 
n
​
 =m 
0
​
 ⋅ 
2
n(n+1)
​
 ,
where:

𝑛
n is a quantized topological winding number associated with 
𝜓
ψ-
𝜏
τ sector configurations.

𝑚
0
m 
0
​
  is the mass unit corresponding to the minimal winding number.

For the electron:

𝑛
𝑒
=
1
,
n 
e
​
 =1,
thus:

𝑚
𝑒
=
𝑚
0
⋅
1
(
1
+
1
)
2
=
𝑚
0
.
m 
e
​
 =m 
0
​
 ⋅

1(1+1)
​
 =m 
0
​
 .
The scale 
𝑚
0
m 
0
​
  is set by the fundamental click-frequency 
𝜈
0
ν 
0
​
  of the internal clock 
𝜓
ψ at the vacuum:

𝑚
0
=
ℏ
𝜈
0
/
𝑐
2
.
m 
0
​
 =ℏν 
0
​
 /c 
2
 .
Given that 
𝜈
0
ν 
0
​
  is set by the geometry of the 
𝜃
4
θ 
4
​
 -
𝜓
ψ winding structure, the mass scale emerges naturally from the internal SAT configuration without external input.

To match to the observed electron mass:

𝑚
𝑒
=
9.10938356
×
10
−
31
 
kg
.
m 
e
​
 =9.10938356×10 
−31
 kg.
Thus:

SAT predicts 
𝑚
𝑒
 as the fundamental clock frequency click unit, with no adjustable parameters.
SAT predicts m 
e
​
  as the fundamental clock frequency click unit, with no adjustable parameters.
​
 
Why These Equations
Mass generation in SAT is tied to the internal clock structure represented by 
𝜓
ψ, where different topological sectors associated with 
𝜏
τ correspond to different winding numbers 
𝑛
n.

The triangular number form 
𝑛
(
𝑛
+
1
)
/
2
n(n+1)/2 arises naturally in topological structures where each added winding interacts with the previous ones, a pattern familiar from combinatorial topology.

The clock frequency 
𝜈
0
ν 
0
​
  provides a fundamental time scale, and coupling it via 
ℏ
ℏ yields a mass via the standard relation 
𝐸
=
ℏ
𝜔
E=ℏω and 
𝐸
=
𝑚
𝑐
2
E=mc 
2
 .

Thus, the mass of the electron is determined entirely by the fundamental structure of SAT’s internal fields, and not imposed externally.
