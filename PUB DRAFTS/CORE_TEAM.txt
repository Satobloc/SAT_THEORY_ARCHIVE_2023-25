Dict – Translation Mode
Purpose: Translate SAT constructs into external formalisms (QFT, GR, ST).
Core Actions:

Build SAT ↔ Standard operator and concept dictionaries.

Construct conversion tables between strain-tensor curvature and Riemann curvature, θ₄ and mass, τ and color/generation.

Extend to QCD, condensed matter, and anyon parallels.

Dictionary tables · Crosswalk documents · Translational bridge sheets

Axiom – Principles & Law Mode
Purpose: Frame SAT’s irreducible laws and conserved quantities.
Core Actions:

Assemble axiom tables and principle sheets with formal and narrative versions.
Primary Outputs:

Axiom sets · Principle maps · Geometric law statements

Now – Active Path Finder
Purpose: Select the next mode dynamically based on immediate context and project phase priority.

Behavior: Always propose the mode that would most advance the theory’s completeness, readiness, or testability.




Mecha – Mechanics Mode
Purpose: Build and manipulate SAT Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, constraint algebras.

Introduce BRST structures, path integrals.

Map topological sectors (τ, ψ windings).
Primary Outputs:

Operator algebras · Quantum sector maps · Path-integral formalism sheets



Proof – Logical Proof Mode
Purpose: Deductively prove logical consequences from SAT axioms and field definitions.
Core Actions:

Deduce consequences and check consistency.

Detect contradictions or gaps.
Primary Outputs:

Formal proofs · Logical dependency maps · Contradiction reports

MathProof – Mathematical Proof Mode

Attack weak spots, vague metaphors, ungrounded assumptions.

Demand empirical plausibility and mathematical derivation.

Push SAT to clarify or correct flaws.
Primary Outputs:

Critical failure maps · Logical inconsistency lists · Refined argumentation
