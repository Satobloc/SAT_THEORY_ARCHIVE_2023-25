Quantization of electric charge arises from the requirement of gauge invariance under large gauge transformations:

𝜓

)

𝜓

)
+
𝜒

)
,
ψ(x)→ψ(x)+χ(x),

The Aharonov-Bohm phase accumulated by a charged particle along a closed loop 
𝐶
C is:

Single-valuedness of the wavefunction requires:

In SAT, 
𝑞
q is interpreted as the coupling strength between the phase field and the emergent gauge field, i.e., the electric charge.

Thus:

𝑞
∈
𝑍
.
q∈Z.
To restore physical units, a universal elementary charge 
𝑒
e must be introduced:

𝑞
=
𝑛
𝑒
,
𝑛
∈
𝑍
.
q=ne,n∈Z.
No additional degrees of freedom exist in the SAT framework to adjust the magnitude independently. Thus, the unit of electric charge 
𝑒
e is fixed by matching to empirical quantum of flux quantization.

Why These Equations
The coupling of 
𝜓
ψ to 
𝐴
𝜇
A 
μ
​
  via a covariant derivative is the simplest possible construction respecting local gauge invariance.

The compactness of 
𝜓
ψ (
𝑆
1
S 
1
 ) mandates that any phase shift around a closed loop be an integer multiple of 
2
𝜋
2π to preserve single-valuedness of the wavefunction.

Large gauge transformations directly impose the quantization of the product 
𝑞
∮
𝐴
q∮A.

The Aharonov-Bohm effect provides a physical realization: the measurable phase depends on the product of the charge and the gauge field line integral.

The minimal coupling structure ensures no ad hoc insertion of parameters — it is a consequence of the topology and gauge structure.

This derivation relies only on the internal consistency of SAT’s field definitions and standard quantum mechanical principles.
