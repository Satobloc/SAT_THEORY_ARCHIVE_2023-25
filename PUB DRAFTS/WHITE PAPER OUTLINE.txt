Abstract
The Scalar–Angular–Twist (SAT) framework proposes a minimal geometric theory in which the known structures of gravity, quantum field theory, and the Standard Model emerge from the dynamics of four fields: a misalignment angle 
𝜃

θ

​
 , an internal phase 
𝜓
ψ, a

Z

​
  topological twist 
𝜏
τ, and a preferred time-flow vector 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 . These fields are embedded in a foliation geometry where formalism and geometry are inseparable: the metric, gauge symmetries, and mass spectra arise naturally from field misalignments and topological windings.

From this foundation, SAT derives, from first principles and without external input:
the speed of light 
𝑐
c, Planck’s constant 
ℏ
ℏ, the elementary charge 
𝑒
e, the fine-structure constant 
𝛼
α, Newton’s gravitational constant

with deviation less than

Atomic scale properties such as the Bohr radius

𝑅

R

​
 , and the dissociation energy of hydrogen 
𝐻

H

​
  are reproduced within 3% accuracy.
Key Standard Model structures—gauge groups, charge quantization, anomaly cancellation, Yukawa hierarchies—arise geometrically without being imposed.

We present proofs of these derivations, explain the geometric formalism that yields them, and compare SAT to conventional Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), demonstrating that it satisfies or exceeds standard GUT benchmarks with fewer assumptions and no free parameters. We conclude with a discussion of the broader geometric intuition, suggesting pathways to quantum gravity, cosmology, and unification beyond the Standard Model.
