The Bohr radius

0
​
  and the Rydberg constant 
𝑅

​
  are classical results of atomic physics, tied to the fundamental constants 
𝑒

ℏ
ℏ, and 
𝑚
𝑒
m 
e
​
 , all of which SAT derives internally.

In conventional physics:

The Bohr radius 
𝑎

In SAT:

ℏ
ℏ emerges from the compactness of the 
𝜓
ψ field enforcing action quantization.

𝑒
e arises from the topological quantization of the phase coupling to the emergent 
𝑈
(

)
U(1) gauge field.

𝑚
𝑒
m 
e
​
  arises from the clock-frequency spectrum of the 
𝜓
ψ-
𝜏
τ sector.

𝜀
0
ε 
0
​
  is set via the normalization of the gauge kinetic term and dimensional considerations.

𝑐
c arises from the causal structure induced by the foliation field.

Thus, all inputs to the Bohr radius and Rydberg constant are derived quantities in SAT.

Substituting:

Since SAT determines

𝛼

𝑎

a

​
  is fixed without external parameters.

Similarly, expressing 
𝑅

​
  in terms of 
𝛼

ℏ
ℏ, 
𝑐

With

ℏ related to

Therefore:

SAT predicts 
𝑎

 and 
𝑅

 from its internal constants, without external adjustment.
SAT predicts a

Why These Equations
Atomic structure depends fundamentally on the constants 
ℏ
ℏ, 
𝑒
e, 
𝑚
𝑒
m 
e
​
 , and 
𝑐
c. In conventional physics, these are taken as independent empirical constants. In SAT, these constants are not inserted but are consequences of deeper geometric and topological properties:

The phase compactness (
𝜓
ψ) and associated action quantization yield 
ℏ
ℏ.

The topological quantization of gauge fluxes sets 
𝑒
e.

The internal clock winding structure fixes 
𝑚
𝑒
m 
e
​
 .

The causal foliation structure establishes 
𝑐
c.

The coupling to electromagnetic fields normalizes 
𝜀
0
ε 
0
​
 .

Thus, the Bohr radius and Rydberg constant are emergent quantities that naturally fall out once the foundational SAT structures are specified.
