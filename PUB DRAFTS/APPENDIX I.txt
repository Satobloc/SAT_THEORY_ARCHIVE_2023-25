Proof
In SAT, the gauge structure of the Standard Model is not postulated but emerges from the topological and geometric properties of the fundamental fields:

The internal phase field 
𝜓
ψ governs 
𝑈
(
1
)
U(1)-type gauge structures.

The twist field 
𝜏
τ is associated with a discrete 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  symmetry, whose topological excitations can be structured to mimic 
𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3) color dynamics.

The foliation structure defined by 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  provides a natural decomposition of spacetime that parallels the splitting of gauge symmetries.

The construction proceeds as follows:

U(1) Gauge Symmetry
The compactness of the 
𝜓
ψ field (
𝜓
∼
𝜓
+
2
𝜋
ψ∼ψ+2π) naturally gives rise to an emergent 
𝑈

U(1) gauge symmetry:

SU(3) Color Symmetry
The twist field 
𝜏
τ is topologically classified by 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
 , the cyclic group of order 3. In the continuum limit, 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  defects (vortices, domain walls) can be organized into configurations that mimic the algebra of 
𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3), the color group of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

Specifically:

The 
𝑍
3
Z 
3
​
  group has three elements, which correspond to the triality of 
𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3).

Topological excitations classified by 
𝜋

𝑍
3
)
π 
1
​
 (S 
1
 /Z 
3
​
 ) lead to non-trivial braiding statistics.

These braid groups and the associated flux quantization can be mapped onto the root structure of 
𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3), with the Gell-Mann matrices corresponding to local generators of transformations between defect sectors.

SU(2) Weak Symmetry
The structure of the foliation field 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  allows for localized rotations in the spatial slices orthogonal to 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 , forming an 
𝑆
𝑂
(
3
)
SO(3) structure.

Breaking 
𝑆
𝑂
(
3
)
SO(3) symmetry down to 
𝑆
𝑈
(
2
)
SU(2) can be achieved by restricting to double-valued representations (spinors) under these spatial rotations, consistent with the local topology of the SAT foliation structure and the spin structure of fermions.

Thus, 
𝑆
𝑈
(
2
)
SU(2) gauge fields naturally emerge as localized frame rotations of the foliation’s spatial slices, coupling to the spinorial fields that emerge from 
𝜓
ψ-
𝜏
τ sectors.

The independence of the phase 
𝜓
ψ, the twist 
𝜏
τ, and the foliation 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
  implies that the corresponding gauge symmetries are independent at leading order.

Therefore, the emergent gauge group is the direct product:

This matches exactly the gauge group structure of the Standard Model.

Why These Equations
The emergent gauge groups in SAT arise from distinct, non-interfering sectors:

𝑈
(
1
)
U(1) from the phase compactness of 
𝜓
ψ.

𝑆
𝑈
(
3
)
SU(3) from the topological twist structure of 
𝜏
τ, which parallels the triplet structure and color charge confinement mechanisms of QCD.

𝑆
𝑈
(
2
)
SU(2) from localized rotations in the spatial slices orthogonal to 
𝑢
𝜇
u 
μ
 , giving rise to spinor coupling structures.

Each field’s internal topology and geometry suggest the corresponding gauge symmetry naturally, without arbitrary imposition.

The independence of these sectors at low energies leads to the direct product structure characteristic of the Standard Model.
