THE CORE TENENTS OF RMS, AND WHAT ROLE UNDERSTANDING PERCEPTION PLAYS

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) is a comprehensive epistemological framework that challenges traditional notions of certainty and extends into the nature of reality and human perception. Here's a detailed overview of its foundational principles:

PART I: THE RMS FRAMEWORK

Equivalence Principle: A Foundation for Radical Meta-Skepticism

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) establishes the Equivalence Principle as a cornerstone concept, challenging conventional epistemological paradigms. This principle asserts that statements regarding the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. At its core, the Equivalence Principle questions the verifiability of propositions concerning an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

Understanding the Equivalence Principle

The Equivalence Principle posits that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. It suggests that propositions sharing the same evidential support and lacking predictive differentiation are, in essence, devoid of meaningful distinctions. This principle extends the Law of Identity (A=A) to larger philosophical concepts, emphasizing the equal validity of propositions that cannot be distinguished based on available evidence.

Challenging Epistemological Assumptions

By challenging traditional epistemological assumptions, particularly regarding propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness, the Equivalence Principle navigates the boundaries of human knowledge. It highlights the limitations of our ability to discern the validity of statements beyond immediate perceptual experiences, urging a reevaluation of how we conceive of truth and reality.

Unknown vs. Unknowable

In the RMS framework, the concept of the "unknown" refers to aspects of reality beyond our immediate perceptual awareness. These are phenomena that we are currently unaware of but may become known through further exploration or observation. In contrast, the "unknowable" encompasses propositions that posit anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. These are statements that, by their nature, cannot be verified or falsified based on available evidence. The Equivalence Principle applies to these unknowable propositions, asserting their inherent indistinguishability and challenging their meaningfulness in the context of human understanding.

Conclusion

The Equivalence Principle serves as a foundational concept in Radical Meta-Skepticism, reshaping how we perceive truth and knowledge. By highlighting the limitations of human perception and challenging traditional epistemological assumptions, RMS encourages a deeper exploration of the nature of reality and the boundaries of human knowledge.




PART II: ESTABLISHING SHARED TRUTHS

Perceptual Fields Taxonomy

RMS introduces a taxonomy to organize perceptual experiences along dimensions like clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. This taxonomy is personal and varies among individuals. It serves as a framework for discussing personal experiences and facilitates dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework.

Uses in RMS

The taxonomy enhances legibility in discussing personal experiences and provides a foundation for dialogue. It allows for the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to accommodate diverse individual experiences. The taxonomy is not prescriptive but serves as a starting point for dialogue within the RMS framework.

Personal Adaptability

Individuals may construct their taxonomies differently, making them rough-and-ready approximations that are personally useful. For example, the perceptual field of "Interpersonal Symmetry" is introduced to illustrate how the taxonomy can reflect others' experiences. Personal taxonomies will vary, allowing for discussion and exploration of shared truths within the RMS framework.

Likelihood of Approximation

It is emphasized that any such taxonomy of perceptual experiences is a deeply individual exercise. Examples illustrate how taxonomies may differ, such as in the case of synesthesia or sensory deprivation. These examples show the need for a flexible and adaptable taxonomy that can encompass the richness and diversity of human perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.


The taxonomy of perceptual fields in RMS provides a tool for understanding and discussing personal experiences. It is a rough-and-ready approximation that varies among individuals but serves as a foundation for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework.


MY OWN PERSONAL TAXONOMY OF PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE
A few ways of looking at it.

Sensory Input: Directly perceived inputs like sight and sound, with high clarity and granularity, tightly interconnected, and limited conscious control.

Feelings: Direct perceptions such as pain or hunger, with moderate clarity and granularity, moderate coherence, and some conscious control.

Emotions: Direct perceptions like joy or fear, with moderate intensity, less granularity, less coherence, and limited conscious control.

Perceptual Patterns: Indirect perceptions influenced by memory and reasoning, with moderate granularity and coherence, and limited conscious control.

Memories: Non-sensory recollections of past experiences, with variable clarity, less granularity, moderate interconnectedness, and significant conscious control.

Logical Errors/Misunderstandings: Misconceptions perceived through thought or memory, with variable clarity and coherence, and limited conscious control.

Dreams: Non-sensory experiences during sleep, with variable clarity, less granularity, moderate interconnectedness, and significant conscious control.

Dreamless Sleep: Absence of perceptual experiences during sleep, with no clarity or granularity, coherent, and limited conscious control.

Hallucinatory Altered States: Direct hallucinatory perceptions, with variable clarity and granularity, coherence, and limited conscious control.

Illusions: False sensory perceptions, with variable clarity and granularity, and often under significant conscious control.

Meditative Altered States: Altered perceptions through meditation, with variable clarity and coherence, and achieved through conscious effort.

Thought: Mediator for all other perceptions, with limited clarity and coherence, and significant conscious control.

Logic: Reasoning and mathematics, with significantly enhanced clarity, highly granular, highly cohesive, and largely under conscious control.

Interpersonal Synergy: Heightened emotional connection with another person, with less clarity than sensory perception but more than most emotions, heightened granularity, fairly strong coherence, and moderate conscious control.

Dreams
Dreamless Sleep
Hallucinatory Altered States
Illusions
Meditative Altered States

Interpersonal Synergy
Sensory Input [sight, sound, etc. directly impinging on consciousness]: very clear, very granular, tightly and coherently interconnected, under very limited conscious control (e.g., through movement, physical manipulation), directly perceived.

Feelings [pain, arousal, hunger, etc. fairly directly impinging on consciousness]: fairly clear, moderately granular, moderately coherently interconnected, under some conscious control (e.g., I can take a pain reliever, I can eat).

Emotions [joy, fear, anger, etc. fairly directly impinging on consciousness; may include thought-mediated emotional perceptions such as aesthetic experience]: moderately clear, less granular, less coherently interconnected, under somewhat limited conscious control (e.g., with effort, I can psych myself up or calm myself down).

Perceptual Patterns [ingrained or learned notions about the integration between various senses, and the interconnections between the various perceptual fields -- indirectly perceived through thought, influenced by memory and reasoning; generally built up through patterns over time and as such, time perception may be integral to or a subset of perceptual patterns, may also include less directly perceived associations such as synesthesia and intuition]: moderately granular, moderately coherent, under fairly limited conscious control (e.g., I have strong expectations about the world, but through thought, I can sometimes change the framework of those expectations).

Memories [non-sensory simulacra of past experiences of the other perceptual fields, indirectly perceived through thought, sometimes through dreams]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g., I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my conscious choice).

Logical errors/misunderstandings [disconnections misperceived as connections -- indirectly perceived through thought or memory]: variable clarity, variable coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g., I can attempt to correct errors once brought to my attention, but otherwise, I am largely unaware of the errors).

Dreams [non-sensory simulacra of experiences of the other perceptual fields, directly perceived through experience while sleeping, sometimes mixed with or influenced by sensory input received during sleep]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g., I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my conscious choice).

Dreamless sleep [almost entirely imperceptible experience characterized by the absence of other perceptual fields during sleep, though sometimes sensory, feelings, emotions, and memories can perturb this sense of disconnection from other perceptual fields]: absence of clarity, absence of granularity, coherent (in that the experience is substantially similar from night to night), characterized by the cessation of nearly all connection to other experience, under very limited conscious control (e.g., I can go to bed early, stay up late, set an alarm, etc.).

Hallucinatory altered states [fairly directly impinging on consciousness, experienced as apparently direct impingement, sometimes mediated by thought, of hallucinatory sense experiences that seem to be perturbations or simulacra of other perceptual experiences]: variable clarity (sometimes radically heightened or lowered sense of clarity), highly variable granularity, highly variable interconnectedness and coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g., I can choose to have hallucinations through ingestion of certain substances, but once the experience begins, I have a more tenuous amount of control over the perceptions impinging on my consciousness, but this ability to control the simulacra of sensory input is noticeably increased with respect to my control over normal sensory perception).

Illusions [experienced as fairly directly impinging on sensory perceptions]: variable clarity, variable granularity, experienced as directly integrated into other sensory input but sometimes seem disconnected from the usual perceptual patterns I've learned through experiences and memories (and therefore often confusing) and frequently discontinuous or not coherent with other sensory input in the sense that the illusion usually seems temporary and can be broken, often under significant conscious control (e.g., some illusions can be broken and reformed with some degree of conscious effort).

Meditative altered states [perceived alterations to our sense of connectedness to our various perceptual fields -- fairly directly impacting various perceptual fields, especially thought, emotion, pattern perception, and to a lesser degree sensory perception]: variable clarity (sometimes heightened clarity with respect to usual perceptual states), variable coherence, variable interconnectedness and connectedness with other perceptual fields, often achieved only through conscious exertion of effort or strenuous physical experience.

Thought [seems to be the mediator for all other perceptual fields (in the sense that any brain activity can be called "thought," but while much of this thought is involuntary, barely perceived with effort, and under very limited conscious control, there is also conscious thought which is under a great degree of conscious control -- indirectly perceived as ideas and logic and reasoning, often about other perceptual fields and relatedness among them]: limited clarity, variable granularity, somewhat coherent, often under significant conscious control but often under limited or very limited conscious control.

Logic [reasoning, mathematics, etc. experienced as a heightened state of clarity within the perceptual experience of thought]: significantly enhanced clarity of thoughts, highly granular though often less granular than sensory perceptions, highly cohesive although usually only through significant conceptual effort, largely under conscious control and requires conscious effort to achieve and maintain.

"Interpersonal Synergy". This is extremely heightened emotional excitement characterized by the shared experience of feeling a powerful, almost palpable emotional bond with another person. It has less clarity than does direct sensory perception, but much more clarity and concreteness than most emotional perceptions. It is also characterized by significantly heightened granularity and complexity of the emotional experience, though again not as granular as sensory input. It also has a fairly strong sense of cohesiveness and interconnectedness compared to other emotional states, almost as cohesive as logical perceptions and even pattern awareness. This sensation is also characterized by a shift in thought patterns, reasoning, and to some extent, the perception of other perceptual fields, almost like a semi-persistent altered state of consciousness, with moderate and limited conscious control.
