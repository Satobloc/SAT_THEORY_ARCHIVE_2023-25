Falsifiability Criteria
------------------------
- M (Topology): Nontrivial quantized magnetic flux detection (H^2(M, ℤ) ≠ 0).
- Magnetic Monopoles: Direct or indirect detection; flux quantization.
- Dirac Quantization: Violation falsifies quantum consistency.
- Electric-Magnetic Duality: Asymmetries in field dynamics.
- [∇]: Deviation from projective geodesic motion.
- Ω: Violation of local 4-volume conservation.
- τ: Mass instability or sign flip detection.
- A: Photon mass detection; gauge invariance violation.
- q: Charge non-conservation observation.
- ψ(x): Chirality or Dirac equation failures.
- S_spinor: Spinor dynamics deviations.
- S_A: Gauge dynamics deviations.
- h̄, e, α: Inconsistencies in quantization, fine-structure constant.
- φ(x), v: Failure of symmetry breaking or mass gaps.
- g_μν(x), G: Absence of gravitational dynamics consistent with emergent metric.

Notes:
- All structures rigorously defined under ultra-hostile critic standards.
- No hidden tunable parameters; critic-hardened through Stage 9.
