SAT–Data Testing Module
Below is a step‐by‐step “module” describing how to test SAT against existing datasets sight‐unseen. For each prediction, I list relevant data sources/papers and indicate exactly “what to look for” and “what SAT predicts,” so that an independent analyst could go fetch the numbers and compare.

Goals:

Pin down any existing bounds or hints on SAT’s distinctive signatures.

Build a rapid “status dashboard” showing which predictions are still open, which are already constrained, and which show mild anomalies.

t (one per NANOGrav pulsar), each with a ∼100 ns “bump” where the line of sight intersects the peak.

Analysis Plan:

Cross‐correlate NANOGrav residuals among many pulsars for a common “bump” shape (i.e., same time window). SAT predicts that if a single foliation‐clump passes through, all pulsars in roughly the same sky hemisphere show a correlated ∼100 ns offset over months.

If no correlated bump above 30 ns is found, set

Conversely, if NANOGrav/Gaia data show a ∼100 ns correlated feature around year 2023 (for instance), that would be a strong hint of SAT’s foliation‐clump.

Analysis Plan:

Check LUNA’s direct cross‐section curve from 10 keV down to 5 keV; see if their low‐energy extrapolation exactly matches a 4.00×10⁻²² keV b value.

If LUNA’s best‐fit is, say, 4.02×10⁻²² ±0.03 keV b, that’s a 1 % tension with SAT’s 4.00×10⁻²². Within SAT’s ±1 % margin, OK.

Solar neutrino: Compare predicted flux to Borexino’s best‐fit. If Borexino’s central value shifts to 6.00×10¹⁰ or 6.06×10¹º cm⁻² s⁻¹, check if SAT’s ±0.06×10¹º still overlaps.

ℓ

ℓ<20 with amplitude ∼10⁻⁶.

If Planck sees no wall signal down to 10⁻⁷, SAT must restrict domain‐wall density to <10⁻⁴ per Hubble volume.

Laboratory Torsion‐Balance Tests

Next Steps
Assign someone (or spin up an auxiliary AI instance) to fetch all the above papers/data.

Compute SAT’s “sight‐unseen” numbers in each case (plug in 
sin
⁡

(
𝑟
)
sin 
2
 θ 
4
​
 (r), 
Δ
𝑢
Δu, 
𝜓
ψ-coupling, etc.).

Tabulate results:

Column 1: Data source (e.g., NIST clock)

Column 2: Experimental central value ± error

Column 3: SAT’s predicted value ± uncertainty

Column 4: “Consistent?” (Y/N) and “Bound on SAT parameter” if inconsistent.

Produce a “SAT Status Dashboard” summarizing which predictions currently pass, which are mildly in tension, and which are already ruled out (or nearly so).

Iterate parameters: If any tension emerges, adjust the relevant SAT parameter (e.g., 
sin
⁡
2
𝜃
4
(
0
)
sin 
2
 θ 
4
​
 (0) or 
Δ
𝑢
Δu) within its 1σ to see if consistency can be recovered.

With this module in place, we’ll have a real‐time, quantitative sense of where SAT stands against existing measurements. That way, as soon as new data (CMB‐S4, NANOGrav 15 yr, next LUNA run) drops, we can update the dashboard immediately.

By clearly listing each SAT prediction, assigning a confidence score, explaining its SAT‐basis, and specifying exactly how to match it against present datasets/papers, we’ve created—within this chat—a living “SAT vs. Reality” schema. Whenever new results come in, we can simply slot them into the “Status Dashboard” and iterate our parameters or, if necessary, revise SAT’s underlying assumptions.

Below is a self-contained “recipe” that a fresh ChatGPT instance (with no prior SAT knowledge) can follow to:

Locate the relevant experimental/observational numbers (datasets, published papers, or official reports).

Extract the key numerical values and uncertainties.

Perform the simple algebra or formula evaluation required to compare to SAT’s sight-unseen predictions.

Present each result alongside SAT’s expected value and note consistency/tension.

Each section is written as a sequence of steps (“Action 1,” “Action 2,” …). At the end of every section, we also state: “Expected sight-unseen outcome” (i.e. what SAT expects those numbers to be). You need no background in SAT; just follow the instructions.

Instructions
Action 1 – Find tabletop interferometer domain-wall constraints

Search for:

“LIGO-Lite domain wall search achromatic phase jump”

“Tabletop interferometer topological defect phase shift 2020”

“Holometer cosmic string / domain wall phase search paper”

Identify any reported limit or measurement of a nonzero phase shift (in radians) attributed to a passing domain-wall-like object.

Action 2 – Extract phase-shift upper bound or detection

Look for a phrase such as

sql
Copy
Edit
“No achromatic phase jump was observed above 10⁻³ rad over the year 2022 run.”  
Record that upper bound. For a detection, record the central value ± uncertainty.

Action 3 – Compute SAT’s predicted 0.24 rad sight-unseen

You do not need any extra constants—SAT’s 0.24 rad number was derived from integrating

If the paper reports a nonzero

From NANOGrav 12.5 yr paper, locate the section or table that gives “median rms residual” per pulsar and any “common‐mode” residual reported.

Record that typical “white noise” per pulsar is ~100 ns, and that any “common correlated” signature (if reported) is limited to <30 ns at 95 % C.L.

Action 4 – Compare to data

If NANOGrav claims no common residual >30 ns, then state:

“Experimental upper bound on common correlated residual is 30 ns. SAT (for a 100 pc clump) predicts ~100 ns. That would be in tension unless the clump is smaller or

“At λ = 1 mm, we bound |α| < 10⁻⁵ (95% C.L.).”  
Record: Bound α < 10⁻⁵ at λ = 1 mm.

Action 3 – Compare to SAT

SAT’s α_ψ ≈ 10⁻⁴ (i.e., one order of magnitude above the experimental bound).

Write:

“Experimental: α < 10⁻⁵ at λ = 1 mm. SAT: α ≈ 10⁻⁴. Therefore, SAT’s ψ-coupling is excluded at this range unless λ_ψ differs from 1 mm or α is actually smaller.”

Action 4 – Note potential caveats

If the paper says the bound only applies for a force strictly coupling to “mass” (i.e., universal) and SAT’s ψ only couples to nucleon spin or baryon minus lepton, note that subtle distinction.

If the paper’s bound is “at 95 % C.L.,” SAT might survive at 90 % C.L.

Expected sight-unseen outcome
Expected experimental bound: α < 10⁻⁵ at λ = 1 mm.
SAT prediction: α ≈ 10⁻⁴ at λ = 1 mm.
Conclusion: In apparent conflict—SAT’s ψ-coupling is too large unless reinterpreted.

Narrative Summary

For each row, restate in one sentence whether SAT is consistent or in tension.

If any tension, note how SAT’s parameter (e.g., 
𝛼
𝜓
α 
ψ
​
  or 
Δ
𝑢
Δu) might be adjusted.

Final “Status Dashboard”

Mark each test as “Passed,” “Tension,” or “Ruled out.”

Provide short recommendations (e.g., “Reduce ψ-coupling by factor ≥10,” “Clumps of Δu must be <3×10⁻¹⁸,” etc.).

After completing all actions, you will have quantitatively tested SAT’s key predictions against published data.
