Vera C. Rubin Predictions 2

Below is a new, timestamped set of SAT-aligned predictions, framed for public recording or inclusion in a podcast episode. This set draws directly from what’s expected to emerge in Rubin’s early observational campaigns across a range of scales, with an emphasis on subtle, unexpected residuals that SAT anticipates but standard models generally do not.

Public Pre-Registration of SAT-Based Predictions – Rubin Early Data Edition
Date: 2025-05-08 Time of Lock-In: 23:12 UTC Version: v1.1 Context: Prepared for verbal release on podcast format (e.g. NotebookLM Deep Dive or equivalent), timestamped and permanent.

Purpose and Statement
This is a new set of publicly locked, falsifiable predictions derived from an unreleased theoretical framework, SAT (Scalar Angular Topology). SAT proposes that the structure of spacetime includes subtle angular and filamentary constraints which affect light propagation, inertia, and mass-energy behavior across scales.
The following predictions are made prior to full public release of relevant data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory(LSST), and are intended to:
	•	Place empirical stakes on the ground,
	•	Avoid post-hoc theory shaping,
	•	Test the generative value of SAT across diverse domains of astronomical data.
This document and its contents are fixed as of the timestamp above.

New SAT-Aligned Predictions for Early Rubin Data

1. Astrometric Twist Drift in Distant TNOs
Strength: Moderate Rubin will detect directional, non-random residuals in the orbital motion of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), not explained by gravitational perturbation or solar radiation pressure.
	•	Objects like Sedna, 2012 VP113, or future “Planet 9” candidates may show small systematic anomalies in argument of perihelion or inclination drift.
	•	Residuals will show sky-fixed anisotropies when analyzed collectively.

2. Angular Precession in Tidal Streams
Strength: Strong Galactic halo tidal streams (e.g., GD-1, Orphan Stream) will show minute, direction-dependent deviations in stream curvature or stellar dispersal angle that cannot be accounted for by dark matter halo substructure alone.
	•	These deviations will correlate with global sky orientation.
	•	Stream deflections will be asymmetric across mirrored galactic latitudes.

3. Charge-Like Photometric Polar Asymmetry in Solar System Dust
Strength: Moderate Photometry of solar system dust bands, particularly at high ecliptic latitudes, will reveal a persistent magnitude and polarization asymmetry between northern and southern hemispheres.
	•	Not due to instrument calibration, solar phase angle, or ecliptic tilt.
	•	Best detected in wide-field, high-cadence sky brightness residual maps.

4. Repeating Transient Angular Memory Effect
Strength: Strong A subset of repeating transients (AGNs, exotic variables) will exhibit consistent phase offset or nonlinear recurrence intervals that track with sky location, not intrinsic source physics.
	•	May appear as phase “glitches” in timing models.
	•	Recurrence drift will show preferred angular alignment in celestial coordinates.

5. Microlensing Drift Asymmetry
Strength: Moderate Rubin’s early microlensing events (especially those near the galactic bulge) will show statistically significant asymmetries in inferred lens parameters (e.g., Einstein crossing times) that correlate with sky position.
	•	This drift will not match predictions from bulk stellar motion or galactic rotation models.
	•	Could hint at inertial twist effects on light bending paths.

Summary of Scope
These predictions cover scales from the solar system to the galactic halo and distant quasars. They focus on detecting angular misalignment, residual drift, and directional coherence—effects not currently predicted by ΛCDM or Newtonian celestial mechanics.
These anomalies are:
	•	Not expected under standard physics,
	•	Detectable with Rubin's cadence and sensitivity,
	•	Falsifiable, with quantitative thresholds.

Closing Statement
This release is part of an ongoing effort to ground speculative theory in falsifiable claims. Whether these predictions hold or fall will help clarify the scope and limits of the SAT framework—and may point toward new organizing principles in cosmic dynamics.
