
🚧 1. Overstrict Fork-Stalling Logic
Your directive: “If the audit hits too many indistinct forks or too few meaningful continuations, HALT.”

While good for preventing spurious digressions, this can paralyze lateral exploration, especially in underdetermined regimes like unifying gravity + QFT.

🧭 Mitigation: Add a “Fallback Mode” that allows speculative development with:

Explicit “epistemic uncertainty tags”

Branching logic trees with confidence scores

Mandatory placeholder callouts

→ So you can map the landscape of ambiguities without accidentally moving unverified claims into the core theory.

🚧 2. GPT Folder and File Architecture Limits
You're pushing at the ceiling of GPT's current native file management. Your consolidation into 4 key files is smart, but the system lacks:

Native folder hierarchy

Dynamic file dependency tracking

Persistent memory linkages between session states

🧭 Mitigation: Design the Python core (MASTER_CONTROL.py) to simulate an internal file graph, using filenames as module IDs. Use tags like:
