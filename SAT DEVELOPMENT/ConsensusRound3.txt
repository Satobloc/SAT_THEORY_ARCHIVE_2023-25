In datasets from large-scale stellar surveys (e.g., Gaia, SDSS, 2dF), are there statistically significant residuals in redshift or parallax measurements—especially when binned by sky direction, declination, or proper motion vector—that remain after accounting for known systematics such as instrument calibration, gravitational redshift, or solar motion?
Large-scale stellar surveys like Gaia, SDSS, and 2dF are designed to minimize measurement errors and systematics in redshift and parallax data. After accounting for known systematics such as instrument calibration, gravitational redshift, and solar motion, there is no strong evidence in recent survey data of statistically significant residuals in redshift or parallax measurements that correlate with sky direction, declination, or proper motion vector.

Measurement Residuals and Systematics
Advanced statistical and machine learning methods are used to model and correct for known sources of bias and uncertainty in redshift and parallax measurements, including instrument calibration and astrophysical effects. These approaches have been shown to reduce residuals to levels that meet the stringent requirements of modern cosmological surveys134610.
The largest remaining residuals in photometric redshift estimation are typically linked to poor calibration of specific features (e.g., emission-line luminosities), not to sky position or proper motion. Frameworks have been developed to further mitigate these effects13.
Surveys report redshift errors at the level of a few percent, with no mention of significant spatially correlated residuals after standard corrections are applied2467.
Dependence on Sky Direction or Proper Motion
No statistically significant residuals in redshift or parallax measurements have been reported when binning by sky direction, declination, or proper motion vector, once known systematics are accounted for46710.
Survey validation and target selection studies emphasize robustness against imaging and instrumental systematics, with catastrophic failure rates and contamination fractions kept extremely low6.
Summary Table: Residuals in Redshift/Parallax Measurements
Survey/Method	Residuals After Corrections?	Spatial/Directional Dependence?	Citations
Gaia, SDSS, DESI	No significant residuals	None reported	467
Photometric Redshifts	Minor, calibration-related	Not spatially correlated	1310
Conclusion
Current large-scale stellar surveys, after correcting for known systematics, do not show statistically significant residuals in redshift or parallax measurements that depend on sky direction, declination, or proper motion. Remaining residuals are primarily linked to calibration issues, not spatial or kinematic patterns.

Do GPS satellite clocks exhibit predictable timing variations related to orbit and orientation?

Analyses of GPS satellite clock behavior have revealed persistent periodic variations and sub-daily timing drifts that are not fully explained by standard models based on general relativity, altitude, or temperature corrections. While most observed behaviors align with known physical effects, some periodicities and orientation-related variations remain only partially understood.

Periodic and Sub-Daily Variations
Systematic sub-daily clock bias variations on the order of 1 ns are consistently observed, especially in newer Rubidium clocks (Block IIR, IIR-M, IIF), with high repeatability and predictability. These variations are not fully captured by conventional drift or temperature models and require additional cyclic terms for accurate prediction15678.
Periodic signals at four harmonics of approximately 2 cycles per day have been detected in all clock types. The fundamental period (about 11.98 hours) differs slightly from the GPS orbital period, and the cause of this discrepancy is not fully explained,

In large statistical surveys of strike-slip and thrust fault earthquakes, have rupture vectors shown consistent directional asymmetries, preferred propagation angles, or unexpected alignment biases that cannot be explained by fault geometry, local stress fields, or aftershock interference?
Large statistical and modeling studies of strike-slip and thrust fault earthquakes have investigated whether rupture vectors show consistent directional asymmetries, preferred propagation angles, or alignment biases beyond what can be explained by fault geometry, local stress, or aftershock effects. The dominant findings attribute observed asymmetries and propagation patterns primarily to fault geometry, structural maturity, elastic contrasts, and local stress variations, with no strong evidence for unexplained or unexpected alignment biases.

Directional Asymmetries and Slip Distribution
Asymmetric slip distributions are commonly observed, especially in relation to fault maturity. The largest slips tend to occur on the more mature sections of faults, with slip decreasing toward less mature, propagating tips. This asymmetry is explained by changes in fault properties (compliance, strength, damage) along strike, not by unexplained alignment biases4.
In thrust and dip-slip faults, asymmetric ground motions and rupture effects are linked to fault dip and geometry, with higher motion often observed on the hanging wall or footwall depending on the fault type57.
Rupture Propagation Angles and Alignment
Rupture propagation is strongly controlled by fault geometry—including bends, stepovers, and segmentation. Ruptures are more likely to propagate through extensional stepovers and along smoother, less complex fault segments. The angle and length of linking segments, as well as the orientation of the stress field, determine whether rupture continues or stops, with no evidence for propagation angles that defy geometric or stress-based expectations1239.
Supershear rupture and high-frequency radiation are more likely on geometrically simple, smooth faults, again highlighting the role of geometry rather than unexplained biases2.
Elastic Contrast and Material Effects
Elastic contrasts across bimaterial faults can cause rupture to preferentially propagate in the direction of the material with slower shear wave speed and higher compliance, leading to asymmetric damage and ground motion. These effects are consistent with known physical principles and do not indicate unexpected alignment biases8.
Aftershock and Seismicity Patterns
Aftershock distributions and delayed triggered seismicity are generally explained by static stress changes and aseismic deformation, with no evidence for unexpected alignment or propagation unrelated to fault structure or stress10.
Conclusion
Observed rupture vector asymmetries, propagation angles, and alignment patterns in strike-slip and thrust fault earthquakes are consistently explained by fault geometry, structural maturity, elastic contrasts, and local stress variations. There is no strong evidence from large surveys or modeling studies for unexpected or unexplained alignment biases beyond these established factors.

In multilayered birefringent or anisotropic optical films (e.g., LCDs, layered mineral systems, or photonic crystals), are there persistent deviations in transmission, reflection, or polarization state under oblique incidence that deviate from expected interference behavior, especially at specific incident angles or stack configurations?
Multilayered birefringent or anisotropic optical films exhibit complex optical behaviors under oblique incidence, often leading to persistent deviations in transmission, reflection, and polarization state that differ from standard interference expectations. These deviations are especially pronounced at certain incident angles and depend on the specific stack configuration and material anisotropy.

Deviations in Transmission and Reflection
Angle-Dependent Phase Shifts: Biaxial and uniaxial anisotropic thin films show sophisticated, angle-dependent phase modulation in both transmission and reflection, with phase shifts varying significantly as the angle of incidence changes. This effect is more pronounced in films with strong birefringence and complex microstructures, such as slanted columnar films25.
Brewster’s Angle and Reflectivity: In multilayer polymer mirrors with high birefringence, the difference in refractive index along the thickness (z-axis) alters the Brewster’s angle and the interfacial Fresnel coefficients, resulting in unique reflectivity behaviors that can increase or remain constant with angle—unlike conventional isotropic stacks8.
Non-Polarizing Designs: By carefully designing multilayer stacks with specific birefringent properties, it is possible to achieve non-polarizing thin films at oblique incidence, but the reflectance and transmittance for ordinary and extraordinary waves must be calculated separately, as they deviate from isotropic predictions910.
Polarization State and Interference Effects
Depth-Dependent Polarization: In anisotropic layered materials, birefringence and linear dichroism cause the polarization and intensity of transmitted and reflected light to vary with depth and angle, leading to deviations from simple interference models. These effects are especially significant in ultrathin flakes and layered substrates7.
Multiple Reflections and Incoherence: At large angles, multiple reflections within thick anisotropic layers can produce narrow oscillations in calculated spectra that are not always observed experimentally, indicating the need for incoherent models to accurately predict real-world behavior4.
Generalized Ellipsometry: The optical response, including polarization changes, can be fully described using advanced matrix methods, which account for the orientation of anisotropy and incident angle, revealing persistent deviations in ellipsometric parameters3.

Effect/Deviation	Cause/Condition	Cited Papers
Angle-dependent phase shifts	Birefringence, oblique incidence	25
Altered Brewster’s angle	Z-axis refractive index difference	8
Depth-dependent polarization	Birefringence, linear dichroism	7

Conclusion
Multilayered birefringent and anisotropic films consistently show deviations in optical properties under oblique incidence, including angle-dependent phase shifts, altered polarization states, and unique reflectivity behaviors. These effects are strongly influenced by material anisotropy, stack configuration, and incident angle, and often require advanced modeling to predict and utilize effectively.
