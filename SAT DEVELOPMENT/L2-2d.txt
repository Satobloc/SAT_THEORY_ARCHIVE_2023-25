Key Tests of SAT Prediction:

Does τ disorder induce geometric reshaping in θ₄(x,y)?

Do high-disorder zones flatten θ₄ gradients?

Do coherent τ domains stabilize θ₄ into plateaus?

🕐 ETA: First output after ~10⁴ steps, final after ~10⁵.
Include notes on convergence behavior and any instabilities.
