So, are there any specific subjects or styles you'd like us to embark upon first?

You said:
I think I'd like to try an experiment. I've been using ChatGPT almost daily for about six months now and one of the things I've found challenging is getting a good reproduction of the style in which I write prompts for AI art. To that end, I would like you analyze some passages and describe their content, style, and grammatical and linguistic approaches, then see if you could closely reproduce my promptcraft approach in developing new prompts. Sound good?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Nathan! I'm thrilled to participate in this experiment and help you refine your promptcraft approach for AI art. Please go ahead and provide me with some passages that exemplify the style you're aiming for. Once I've analyzed their content, style, and linguistic nuances, I'll do my utmost to closely replicate that style in crafting new prompts. Let's dive into this creative endeavor together!

"Embark upon an odyssey of iridescent cravat-clad cephalopod maestros conducting a symphony of piebald terracotta melodies within the sprawling expanse of a Peruvian-octoberfest-barmaid-astromariner-cowgirl cosmos. Imagine their gravitational waltz within a regolith-bubble-dome-library, where Glarphasertran echoes with pan-European Shakespearean sonnets that glisten like 16th-century stage daguerreotypes. Feel the cinematic dof 7 as their laparoscopic verses cascade through the ages, transcending time itself."

How did I do, Nathan? Did I manage to capture the essence of your unique promptcrafting style?

You said:
That’s pretty good, but one important feature of my typical style is that the writing is usually composed of concise(ish) and purely descriptive statements without the context of transitions or authorial voice that you’ve thrown in (“embark upon and odyssey…” or “imagine their…” or “feel the…”). Can you try to reproduce the condensed descriptive style and other grammatical, orthographic and punctuational quirks of my examples free from the narrative flourishes?
ChatGPT said:
Of course, Nathan! I appreciate your precision in describing the style you're aiming for. Let's distill the essence of your promptcrafting style by focusing solely on concise and descriptive statements, devoid of narrative transitions or authorial voice:
