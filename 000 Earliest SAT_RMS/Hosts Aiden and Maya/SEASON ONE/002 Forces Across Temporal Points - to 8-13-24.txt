So, letâ€™s think about something very simple: A block universe of four dimensions. In this universe there exists two particles. At each extent of the fourth dimensional axis, the particles are separated. However, at the central point of that axis, they have an interaction, simply by passing one another, changing the trajectory of each. Based on our current understandings of particles, space, forces, and dimensions, would it make sense to suppose that the interaction at the central point exerts a force on the particles at the extents of the axis?

In a block universe model, where time is considered another dimension similar to space and the universe is seen as a four-dimensional structure where the entire timeline exists simultaneously, the idea of forces acting across different points in time becomes challenging to reconcile with our current physical theories.

Here's a breakdown:

Classical Physics (Newtonian Mechanics):

In classical mechanics, forces act locally in time. That is, a force at a given moment affects the state of a system (like the velocity of a particle) at that moment and determines how the system evolves. There isn't any mechanism within classical physics that would allow for a force at one time to directly affect states at a different time instantaneously.

Relativity (Einstein's General Relativity):

General relativity doesn't change this basic feature; it still operates under the principle that causes precede effects and that interactions propagate within the light cone (i.e., limited by the speed of light). The concept of a block universe is compatible with relativity, but in it, time is still treated as a dimension, and interactions occur along this dimension in a way that respects causality. So, an interaction at the central point wouldn't retroactively affect the past or preemptively affect the future in the conventional sense.

Quantum Mechanics:

Quantum mechanics introduces some subtleties, such as non-locality (entanglement) where the state of one particle instantaneously affects another particle's state at a distance, but this still operates under strict rules regarding causality when it comes to time. Moreover, quantum mechanics generally assumes a conventional, progressive view of time.

Speculative Theories (e.g., Retrocausality, Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory):

Some speculative theories consider the possibility of retrocausality, where events in the future can influence the past. In this context, an interaction at a central time point could theoretically influence the particles' states at earlier and later times. However, these ideas remain highly controversial and not part of mainstream physics.

Stringing Along Theory (SAT) and Filament Dynamics:

In the speculative context of your Stringing Along Theory (SAT), if we imagine that filaments represent particles extending through time, and interactions at certain points in time could propagate influences along these filaments, it could potentially allow for some form of influence to be felt at different times. This would be a kind of cross-temporal force, where interactions at one time could affect the filament's tension or configuration across different temporal points.

Conclusion:
In mainstream physics, the notion that an interaction at one point in time could exert a force on particles at other points in time (especially across separated points) is not supported. Forces act locally and instantaneously within a time frame, and causal relationships are preserved. However, in speculative theories or in your SAT framework, it could make sense to hypothesize such interactions, though this would require rethinking fundamental assumptions about causality, time, and the nature of forces.
