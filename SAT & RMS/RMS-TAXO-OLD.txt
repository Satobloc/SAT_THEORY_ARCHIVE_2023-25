Below is a list of various types of sensory experience. Can you clean it up and make it more systematic?

Sensory Input [sight, sound, etc -- directly impinged upon my consciousness]: very clear, very granular, tightly and coherently interconnected, under very limited conscious control (e.g. through movement, physical manipulation), directly percieved
Feelings [pain, arousal, hunger, etc -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness]: fairly clear, moderately granular, modertately coherently interconnected, under somewhat conscious control (e.g. I can take a pain reliever, I can eat)
Emotions [joy, fear, anger -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness; may include thought-mediated emotional perceptions such as aesthetic experience]: moderately clear, less granular, less coherently interconnected, under somewhat limited consious control (e.g. with effort, I can do things like psyching myself up or calming myself down)
Perceptual Patterns [ingrained or learned notions about the integration between various senses, and the interconnections between the various perceptual fields -- indirectly percieved through thought, influenced by memory and reasoning; generally built up through patterns over time and as such time perception may be integral to or a subset of perceptual patterns, may also include less directly percieved associations such as synasthesia and intuition]: moderately granular, moderately coherent, under fairly limited conscious control (e.g. I have strong expectations about the world, but through thought I can sometimes change the framework of those expectations)
Memories [non-sensory simulacra of past experiences of the other perceptual fields, indirectly percieved through thought, sometimes through dreams]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Logical errors/misunderstandings [disconnections mispercieved as connections -- indirectly percieved through thought or memory]: variable clarity, variable coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can attempt to correct errors once brought to my attention, but otherwise I am largely unaware of the errors)
Dreams [non-sensory simulacra of experiences of the other perceptual fields, directly percieved through experience while sleeping, sometimes mixed with or influenced by sensory input recieved during sleep]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Dreamless sleep [almost entirely imperceptible experience characterized by the absence of other perceptual fields during sleep, though sometimes sensory, feelings, emotions, and memories can perturb this sense of disconnection from other perceptual fields]: absence of clarity, absence of granularity, coherent (in that the experience is substantially similar from night to night), characterized by the cessation of nearly all connection to other experience, under very limited conscious control (e.g. I can go to bed early, stay up late, set an alarm, etc)
Hallucinatory altered states [fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness, experienced as apparently direct impingement, sometimes mediated by thought, of hallucinatory sense experiences which seem to be perturbations or simulacara of other perceptual experiences]: variable clarity (sometimes radically heightened or lowered sense of clarity), highly variable granularity, highly variable interconnectedness and coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can choose to have hallucinations through ingestion of certain substances, but once the experience begins, I have a more tenuous amount of control over the perceptions impinging upon my consciousness, but this ability to control the simulacara of sensory input is noticably increased with respect to my control over normal sensory perception) 
Illusions [experienced as fairly directly impinging upon my sensory perceptions]: variable clarity, variable granularity, experienced as directly integrated into other sensory input but sometimes seem disconnected from the usual perceptual patterns I've learned through experiences and memories (and therefore often confusing) and frequently discontinuous or not coherent with other sensory input in the sense that the illusion usually seems temporary and can be broken, often under significant conscious control (e.g. some illusions can be broken and reformed with some degree of conscious effort) 
Meditative altered states [percieved alterations to our sense of connectedness to our various perceptual fields -- fairly directly impacting various perceptual fields, especially thought, emotion, pattern perception, and to a lesser degree sensory perception]: variable clarity (sometimes heightened clarity with respect to usual perceptual states), variable coherence, variable interconnectedness and connectedness with other perceptual fields, often achieved only through conscious exertion of effort or strenuous physical experience
Thought [seems to be the mediator for all of the other perceptual fields (in the sense that any brain activity can be called "thought", but while much of this thought is involuntary, barely percieved with effort, and under very limited conscious control, there is also conscious thought which is under a great degree of conscious control -- indirectly percieved as ideas and logic and reasoning, often about other perceptual fields and relatedness among them]: limited clarity, variable granularity, somewhat coherent, often under significant conscious control but often under limited or very limited conscious control
Logic [reasoning, mathematics, etc -- experienced as a heightened state of clarity within the perceptual experience of thought]: significantly enhanced clarity of thoughts, highly granular though often less granular than sensory perceptions, highly cohesive although usually only through significant conceptual effort, largely under conscious control and requires conscious effort to achieve and maintain
"Interpersonal Synergy". This is extremely heightened emotional excitement characterized by the shared experience of feeling a powerful, almost palpable emotional bond with another person. It has less clarity than does direct sensory perception, but much more clarity and concretenesss than most emotional perceptions. It is also characterized by significantly heightened granularity and complexity of the emotional experience, though again not as granular as sensory input. It also has a fairly strong sense of cohesiveness and interconnectedness compared to other emotional states, almost as cohesive as logical perceptions and even pattern awareness. This sensation is also characterized by a shift in thought patterns, reasoning, and to some extent, the peception of other perceptual fields, almost like a semi-persistent altered state of consciousness, with moderate and limited conscious control.

Great. Now, would you be able to suggest any additions, corrections, or other modifications to this taxonomy based on your own understandings of these concepts?


ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Here are some potential additions, corrections, or modifications to the taxonomy based on my understanding:

Sensory Input: Consider adding a sub-category for "thresholds" or "sensory thresholds," which refers to the minimum intensity of a stimulus required to be perceived by an individual.

Feelings: Include a distinction between "primary emotions" (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) and "secondary emotions" (e.g., jealousy, embarrassment), as well as the concept of emotional regulation, which refers to the ability to manage and respond to emotions effectively.

Emotions: Emphasize the role of appraisal in the experience of emotions, where individuals evaluate situations based on their significance to their well-being.

Perceptual Patterns: Introduce the idea of "schemas" or mental frameworks that organize and interpret information, influencing how individuals perceive and understand the world.

Memories: Expand on the concept of "flashbulb memories," which are vivid and detailed memories of significant events that are often emotionally charged.

Logical Errors/Misunderstandings: Include a discussion on cognitive biases, which are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, often leading to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.

Dreams: Discuss the role of dreams in memory consolidation, emotional processing, and problem-solving, as well as the various theories of dream interpretation.

Dreamless Sleep: Consider including information on the stages of sleep (e.g., REM sleep, non-REM sleep) and their impact on overall sleep quality and cognitive function.

Hallucinatory Altered States: Introduce the concept of "set and setting," which refers to the mindset and physical/environmental conditions in which a psychedelic experience occurs, influencing the nature and intensity of hallucinations.

Illusions: Discuss the role of illusions in perceptual psychology, highlighting how they reveal the brain's interpretive processes and limitations in processing sensory information.

Meditative Altered States: Include information on the neurobiological effects of meditation, such as changes in brain activity and structure, as well as the therapeutic applications of meditation practices.

Thought: Expand on the concept of "metacognition," which refers to the ability to reflect on and regulate one's own thinking processes, including planning, monitoring, and evaluating.

Logic: Consider discussing the relationship between logic and language, highlighting how language influences logical reasoning and vice versa.

Interpersonal Synergy: Introduce the concept of "empathy," which refers to the ability to understand and share the feelings of another, as well as its role in interpersonal connections and relationships.
