Can you take the content below and clean it up, making it into a comprehensive explanation of the RMS as it is explained herein?

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) is a comprehensive epistemological framework that challenges traditional notions of certainty and extends into the nature of reality and human perception. Here's a detailed overview of its foundational principles:

PART I: THE RMS FRAMEWORK 

Equivalence Principle:
Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) introduces the Equivalence Principle as a foundational concept that challenges traditional epistemological assumptions. This principle posits that statements about the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. The Equivalence Principle serves as a lens through which RMS examines the nature of reality, emphasizing the inability to discern the validity of propositions regarding an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

The Equivalence Principle at the core of Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) posits that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. This principle asserts that such propositions, devoid of verifiable distinctions, lack meaningfulness. In essence, it is a restatement of the Law of Identity (A=A) as applied to larger philosophical concepts, emphasizing the inherent equality of propositions sharing the same evidential support and lacking predictive differentiation.

The foundational concept of the Equivalence Principle challenges traditional epistemological assumptions, particularly regarding propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. By asserting the indistinguishability of propositions with no differential predictions, RMS navigates the limitations of human knowledge and probes the meaningfulness of statements beyond immediate perceptual experiences.

Unknown vs. Unknowable:
In the RMS framework, the "unknown" refers to aspects beyond our immediate perceptual awareness. In contrast, the "unknowable" encompasses propositions positing anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. The Equivalence Principle is applied to these unknowable propositions, asserting their inherent indistinguishability and challenging their meaningfulness.

Perceptual Fields Taxonomy:
RMS develops a taxonomy that organizes perceptual experiences along dimensions such as clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. It's crucial to clarify that this taxonomy is personal and subject to significant variation among individuals. The dimensions serve as a framework to enhance legibility in discussing personal experiences, providing a foundation for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. Examples like thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy illustrate the adaptable nature of the taxonomy, recognizing that individuals may construct their taxonomies differently.RMS encourages the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to accommodate diverse individual experiences. It recognizes that personal taxonomies will vary, allowing for discussion and exploration of shared truths within the framework. The taxonomy is not prescriptive but serves as a starting point for dialogue, demonstrating the flexibility needed to encompass the richness and diversity of human perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.

It is emphasized that any such taxonomy of perceptual experiences is a deeply individual exercize, and attempting to organize one's fields of perceptions is probably always going to be a rough-and-ready approximation that is successful insofar as it is personally useful, and insofar as it establishes shared language for talking about shared truths. 

For example, my idiosyncratic perceptual experience of Interpersonal Symmetry is introduced as an example to illustrate the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to reflect others' experiences. Another example might be the possibility of deepening or breaking out some of the perceptual fields identified, such as by charactarizing each sensory input type as its own perceptual experience, or removing or otherwise adapting some of them, as would likely be the case for someone who lacks sight or hearing, or in the case of powerful synasthesias. Everybody's personal taxonomy will look at least slightly, and perhaps profoundly different (e.g. in the case of the synasthete, numbers and colors, and mathematics might be deeply interconnected while they aren't for me, a deaf person might remove or re-classify hearing, perhaps adding echolocation; the point of the taxonomy is to try to establish more legible discussion of individuals' personal perceptual experiences, thereby opening the door to dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. The same sorts of considerations apply to the interrelatedness of the fields as I've indicated below in my personal taxonomy. 

What follows are two different rough-and-ready ways to create a personal taxonomy of perceptual fields.

The Various Perceptual Fields in my personal taxonomy:
Sensory Input
Feelings
Emotions
Perceptual Patterns
Memories
Logical errors/misunderstandings
Dreams
Dreamless Sleep
Hallucinatory Altered States
Illusions
Meditative Altered States
Thought
Logic
Interpersonal Synergy

Sensory Input [sight, sound, etc -- directly impinged upon my consciousness]: very clear, very granular, tightly and coherently interconnected, under very limited conscious control (e.g. through movement, physical manipulation), directly percieved
Feelings [pain, arousal, hunger, etc -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness]: fairly clear, moderately granular, modertately coherently interconnected, under somewhat conscious control (e.g. I can take a pain reliever, I can eat)
Emotions [joy, fear, anger -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness; may include thought-mediated emotional perceptions such as aesthetic experience]: moderately clear, less granular, less coherently interconnected, under somewhat limited consious control (e.g. with effort, I can do things like psyching myself up or calming myself down)
Perceptual Patterns [ingrained or learned notions about the integration between various senses, and the interconnections between the various perceptual fields -- indirectly percieved through thought, influenced by memory and reasoning; generally built up through patterns over time and as such time perception may be integral to or a subset of perceptual patterns, may also include less directly percieved associations such as synasthesia and intuition]: moderately granular, moderately coherent, under fairly limited conscious control (e.g. I have strong expectations about the world, but through thought I can sometimes change the framework of those expectations)
Memories [non-sensory simulacra of past experiences of the other perceptual fields, indirectly percieved through thought, sometimes through dreams]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Logical errors/misunderstandings [disconnections mispercieved as connections -- indirectly percieved through thought or memory]: variable clarity, variable coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can attempt to correct errors once brought to my attention, but otherwise I am largely unaware of the errors)
Dreams [non-sensory simulacra of experiences of the other perceptual fields, directly percieved through experience while sleeping, sometimes mixed with or influenced by sensory input recieved during sleep]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Dreamless sleep [almost entirely imperceptible experience characterized by the absence of other perceptual fields during sleep, though sometimes sensory, feelings, emotions, and memories can perturb this sense of disconnection from other perceptual fields]: absence of clarity, absence of granularity, coherent (in that the experience is substantially similar from night to night), characterized by the cessation of nearly all connection to other experience, under very limited conscious control (e.g. I can go to bed early, stay up late, set an alarm, etc)
Hallucinatory altered states [fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness, experienced as apparently direct impingement, sometimes mediated by thought, of hallucinatory sense experiences which seem to be perturbations or simulacara of other perceptual experiences]: variable clarity (sometimes radically heightened or lowered sense of clarity), highly variable granularity, highly variable interconnectedness and coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can choose to have hallucinations through ingestion of certain substances, but once the experience begins, I have a more tenuous amount of control over the perceptions impinging upon my consciousness, but this ability to control the simulacara of sensory input is noticably increased with respect to my control over normal sensory perception) 
Illusions [experienced as fairly directly impinging upon my sensory perceptions]: variable clarity, variable granularity, experienced as directly integrated into other sensory input but sometimes seem disconnected from the usual perceptual patterns I've learned through experiences and memories (and therefore often confusing) and frequently discontinuous or not coherent with other sensory input in the sense that the illusion usually seems temporary and can be broken, often under significant conscious control (e.g. some illusions can be broken and reformed with some degree of conscious effort) 
Meditative altered states [percieved alterations to our sense of connectedness to our various perceptual fields -- fairly directly impacting various perceptual fields, especially thought, emotion, pattern perception, and to a lesser degree sensory perception]: variable clarity (sometimes heightened clarity with respect to usual perceptual states), variable coherence, variable interconnectedness and connectedness with other perceptual fields, often achieved only through conscious exertion of effort or strenuous physical experience
Thought [seems to be the mediator for all of the other perceptual fields (in the sense that any brain activity can be called "thought", but while much of this thought is involuntary, barely percieved with effort, and under very limited conscious control, there is also conscious thought which is under a great degree of conscious control -- indirectly percieved as ideas and logic and reasoning, often about other perceptual fields and relatedness among them]: limited clarity, variable granularity, somewhat coherent, often under significant conscious control but often under limited or very limited conscious control
Logic [reasoning, mathematics, etc -- experienced as a heightened state of clarity within the perceptual experience of thought]: significantly enhanced clarity of thoughts, highly granular though often less granular than sensory perceptions, highly cohesive although usually only through significant conceptual effort, largely under conscious control and requires conscious effort to achieve and maintain
"Interpersonal Synergy". This is extremely heightened emotional excitement characterized by the shared experience of feeling a powerful, almost palpable emotional bond with another person. It has less clarity than does direct sensory perception, but much more clarity and concretenesss than most emotional perceptions. It is also characterized by significantly heightened granularity and complexity of the emotional experience, though again not as granular as sensory input. It also has a fairly strong sense of cohesiveness and interconnectedness compared to other emotional states, almost as cohesive as logical perceptions and even pattern awareness. This sensation is also characterized by a shift in thought patterns, reasoning, and to some extent, the peception of other perceptual fields, almost like a semi-persistent altered state of consciousness, with moderate and limited conscious control.

To establish shared truths, RMS introduces a Perceptual Fields Taxonomy. This taxonomy organizes perceptual experiences along dimensions like clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. It's crucial to note that this taxonomy is personal and subject to significant variation among individuals. It serves as a framework for enhancing legibility in discussing personal experiences and provides a foundation for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework.

Personal taxonomies will vary, allowing for discussion and exploration of shared truths. For example, one might categorize Sensory Input as having very high clarity and granularity but limited conscious control, while Emotions might be moderately clear and less granular with limited control. Each individual's taxonomy reflects their unique experiences and perceptions, contributing to a broader understanding within the RMS framework.

RMS encourages the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to accommodate diverse individual experiences. By recognizing the variability of personal taxonomies, RMS fosters dialogue about shared truths while acknowledging the complexity and richness of human perceptual experiences.

Perceptual Fields Taxonomy:
RMS introduces a taxonomy to categorize perceptual experiences based on clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. It's important to note that this taxonomy is subjective and varies between individuals. These dimensions serve as a framework to improve communication about personal experiences, facilitating discussions about shared truths within the RMS framework. Examples like thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy demonstrate the adaptable nature of the taxonomy, recognizing that individuals may organize their experiences differently. RMS encourages expanding and adapting the taxonomy to accommodate diverse experiences, emphasizing that personal taxonomies will differ. This approach allows for discussing and exploring shared truths within the framework. The taxonomy is not rigid but acts as a starting point for dialogue, showing the flexibility needed to encompass the diversity of human perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.

It's essential to emphasize that any taxonomy of perceptual experiences is deeply personal. Attempting to organize one's perceptual fields is likely to be a rough approximation that is successful to the extent it is personally useful and establishes a shared language for discussing shared truths.

For instance, my idiosyncratic experience of Interpersonal Symmetry serves as an example to illustrate how the taxonomy can reflect others' experiences. Another example could be deepening or expanding some of the perceptual fields, such as characterizing each sensory input type as its own experience. This taxonomy allows for a more understandable discussion of personal perceptual experiences, enabling dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. Similar considerations apply to the interrelatedness of the fields as indicated below in my personal taxonomy.

Dreamless sleep [almost entirely imperceptible experience characterized by the absence of other perceptual fields during sleep, though sometimes sensory, feelings, emotions, and memories can perturb this sense of disconnection from other perceptual fields]: absence of clarity, absence of granularity, coherent (in that the experience is substantially similar from night to night), characterized by the cessation of nearly all connection to other experience, under very limited conscious control (e.g., I can go to bed early, stay up late, set an alarm, etc.).

Hallucinatory altered states [fairly directly impinging on consciousness, experienced as apparently direct impingement, sometimes mediated by thought, of hallucinatory sense experiences that seem to be perturbations or simulacra of other perceptual experiences]: variable clarity (sometimes radically heightened or lowered sense of clarity), highly variable granularity, highly variable interconnectedness and coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g., I can choose to have hallucinations through ingestion of certain substances, but once the experience begins, I have a more tenuous amount of control over the perceptions impinging on my consciousness, but this ability to control the simulacra of sensory input is noticeably increased with respect to my control over normal sensory perception).

Illusions [experienced as fairly directly impinging on sensory perceptions]: variable clarity, variable granularity, experienced as directly integrated into other sensory input but sometimes seem disconnected from the usual perceptual patterns I've learned through experiences and memories (and therefore often confusing) and frequently discontinuous or not coherent with other sensory input in the sense that the illusion usually seems temporary and can be broken, often under significant conscious control (e.g., some illusions can be broken and reformed with some degree of conscious effort).

Meditative altered states [perceived alterations to our sense of connectedness to our various perceptual fields -- fairly directly impacting various perceptual fields, especially thought, emotion, pattern perception, and to a lesser degree sensory perception]: variable clarity (sometimes heightened clarity with respect to usual perceptual states), variable coherence, variable interconnectedness and connectedness with other perceptual fields, often achieved only through conscious exertion of effort or strenuous physical experience.

Thought [seems to be the mediator for all other perceptual fields (in the sense that any brain activity can be called "thought," but while much of this thought is involuntary, barely perceived with effort, and under very limited conscious control, there is also conscious thought which is under a great degree of conscious control -- indirectly perceived as ideas and logic and reasoning, often about other perceptual fields and relatedness among them]: limited clarity, variable granularity, somewhat coherent, often under significant conscious control but often under limited or very limited conscious control.

Logic [reasoning, mathematics, etc. experienced as a heightened state of clarity within the perceptual experience of thought]: significantly enhanced clarity of thoughts, highly granular though often less granular than sensory perceptions, highly cohesive although usually only through significant conceptual effort, largely under conscious control and requires conscious effort to achieve and maintain.

"Interpersonal Synergy". This is extremely heightened emotional excitement characterized by the shared experience of feeling a powerful, almost palpable emotional bond with another person. It has less clarity than does direct sensory perception, but much more clarity and concreteness than most emotional perceptions. It is also characterized by significantly heightened granularity and complexity of the emotional experience, though again not as granular as sensory input. It also has a fairly strong sense of cohesiveness and interconnectedness compared to other emotional states, almost as cohesive as logical perceptions and even pattern awareness. This sensation is also characterized by a shift in thought patterns, reasoning, and to some extent, the perception of other perceptual fields, almost like a semi-persistent altered state of consciousness, with moderate and limited conscious control.

PART II: ESTABLISHING SHARED TRUTHS

Perceptual Fields Taxonomy

RMS introduces a taxonomy to organize perceptual experiences along dimensions like clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. This taxonomy is personal and varies among individuals. It serves as a framework for discussing personal experiences and facilitates dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework.

Uses in RMS

The taxonomy enhances legibility in discussing personal experiences and provides a foundation for dialogue. It allows for the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to accommodate diverse individual experiences. The taxonomy is not prescriptive but serves as a starting point for dialogue within the RMS framework.

Personal Adaptability

Individuals may construct their taxonomies differently, making them rough-and-ready approximations that are personally useful. For example, the perceptual field of "Interpersonal Symmetry" is introduced to illustrate how the taxonomy can reflect others' experiences. Personal taxonomies will vary, allowing for discussion and exploration of shared truths within the RMS framework.

Likelihood of Approximation

It is emphasized that any such taxonomy of perceptual experiences is a deeply individual exercise. Examples illustrate how taxonomies may differ, such as in the case of synesthesia or sensory deprivation. These examples show the need for a flexible and adaptable taxonomy that can encompass the richness and diversity of human perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.

Conclusion

The taxonomy of perceptual fields in RMS provides a tool for understanding and discussing personal experiences. It is a rough-and-ready approximation that varies among individuals but serves as a foundation for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework.

PART I: THE RMS FRAMEWORK 

Equivalence Principle:
Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) introduces the Equivalence Principle as a foundational concept that challenges traditional epistemological assumptions. This principle posits that statements about the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. The Equivalence Principle serves as a lens through which RMS examines the nature of reality, emphasizing the inability to discern the validity of propositions regarding an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

The Equivalence Principle at the core of Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) posits that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. This principle asserts that such propositions, devoid of verifiable distinctions, lack meaningfulness. In essence, it is a restatement of the Law of Identity (A=A) as applied to larger philosophical concepts, emphasizing the inherent equality of propositions sharing the same evidential support and lacking predictive differentiation.

The foundational concept of the Equivalence Principle challenges traditional epistemological assumptions, particularly regarding propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. By asserting the indistinguishability of propositions with no differential predictions, RMS navigates the limitations of human knowledge and probes the meaningfulness of statements beyond immediate perceptual experiences.

Unknown vs. Unknowable:
In the RMS framework, the "unknown" refers to aspects beyond our immediate perceptual awareness. In contrast, the "unknowable" encompasses propositions positing anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. The Equivalence Principle is applied to these unknowable propositions, asserting their inherent indistinguishability and challenging their meaningfulness.

PART I: THE RMS FRAMEWORK

Equivalence Principle: A Foundation for Radical Meta-Skepticism

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) establishes the Equivalence Principle as a cornerstone concept, challenging conventional epistemological paradigms. This principle asserts that statements regarding the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. At its core, the Equivalence Principle questions the verifiability of propositions concerning an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

Understanding the Equivalence Principle

The Equivalence Principle posits that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. It suggests that propositions sharing the same evidential support and lacking predictive differentiation are, in essence, devoid of meaningful distinctions. This principle extends the Law of Identity (A=A) to larger philosophical concepts, emphasizing the equal validity of propositions that cannot be distinguished based on available evidence.

Challenging Epistemological Assumptions

By challenging traditional epistemological assumptions, particularly regarding propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness, the Equivalence Principle navigates the boundaries of human knowledge. It highlights the limitations of our ability to discern the validity of statements beyond immediate perceptual experiences, urging a reevaluation of how we conceive of truth and reality.

Unknown vs. Unknowable

In the RMS framework, the concept of the "unknown" refers to aspects of reality beyond our immediate perceptual awareness. These are phenomena that we are currently unaware of but may become known through further exploration or observation. In contrast, the "unknowable" encompasses propositions that posit anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. These are statements that, by their nature, cannot be verified or falsified based on available evidence. The Equivalence Principle applies to these unknowable propositions, asserting their inherent indistinguishability and challenging their meaningfulness in the context of human understanding.

Conclusion

The Equivalence Principle serves as a foundational concept in Radical Meta-Skepticism, reshaping how we perceive truth and knowledge. By highlighting the limitations of human perception and challenging traditional epistemological assumptions, RMS encourages a deeper exploration of the nature of reality and the boundaries of human knowledge.

This expanded section provides a more detailed exploration of the Equivalence Principle within the RMS framework, emphasizing its implications for epistemology and our understanding of the unknown and the unknowable.

Can you provide for me an overview of how such issues have been addressed in the past in the philosophical and other literature and explain how RMS differs from past approaches?


ChatGPT said:
In the history of philosophy and epistemology, questions about the nature of reality, truth, and human perception have been central topics of inquiry. Various philosophical traditions and thinkers have approached these questions in different ways, leading to a rich tapestry of theories and perspectives.

One of the earliest and most fundamental debates in philosophy is the question of realism vs. idealism. Realism posits that there is a mind-independent reality that exists whether or not we perceive it, while idealism argues that reality is fundamentally dependent on the mind and its perceptions. This debate has led to nuanced discussions about the nature of perception and the relationship between the mind and the external world.

Another key theme in epistemology is skepticism, which challenges our ability to know anything with certainty. Skepticism raises questions about the reliability of our senses, the limits of language, and the possibility of objective knowledge. Philosophers like Descartes, Hume, and Kant have made significant contributions to the debate on skepticism, each offering their own theories on how we can attain knowledge despite the challenges posed by skepticism.

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) differs from traditional approaches in several ways. Firstly, RMS takes a more radical stance on skepticism by positing the Equivalence Principle, which asserts that statements about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness are inherently indistinguishable. This challenges the traditional notion of objective truth by suggesting that such statements are equally true or false.

Secondly, RMS introduces the Perceptual Fields Taxonomy, which provides a framework for organizing and understanding personal experiences. This taxonomy allows for a more nuanced discussion of truth and reality, taking into account the subjective nature of perception.

Overall, RMS represents a departure from traditional approaches by questioning fundamental assumptions about the nature of reality and knowledge. It offers a new perspective on these age-old questions, emphasizing the limitations of human perception and the need for a more nuanced understanding of truth.






You said:
What about what RMS has to say about perceptual experiences? How does it differ or concord with other writings, philosophical, psychological, biological, etc?


ChatGPT said:
Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) offers a unique perspective on perceptual experiences that differs from traditional philosophical, psychological, and biological viewpoints in several ways:

Subjectivity and Reality: RMS emphasizes the subjectivity of perceptual experiences, suggesting that statements about the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable. This challenges the traditional notion of an objective reality that exists independent of our perceptions.

Equivalence Principle: The Equivalence Principle in RMS asserts that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. This challenges traditional epistemological assumptions about the nature of truth and knowledge.

Taxonomy of Perceptual Fields: RMS introduces a taxonomy to organize perceptual experiences along dimensions like clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. This taxonomy is personal and varies among individuals, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of subjective experiences.

Personal Adaptability: RMS acknowledges the personal adaptability of the taxonomy of perceptual fields, recognizing that individuals may construct their taxonomies differently based on their unique experiences. This contrasts with more prescriptive approaches in traditional philosophy and psychology.

Approximation and Roughness: RMS acknowledges that any taxonomy of perceptual experiences is approximate and rough-and-ready, highlighting the complexity and variability of human perception. This contrasts with more rigid and categorical approaches in traditional philosophy and psychology.

In summary, RMS offers a novel perspective on perceptual experiences that emphasizes subjectivity, personal adaptability, and the limitations of human knowledge. While it differs from traditional viewpoints in several key aspects, it also shares some common themes, such as the recognition of the complexity and variability of human perception.

In the context of RMS's taxonomy of perceptual experiences, the dimensions are defined as follows:

Intensity: The strength or vividness of a perceptual experience. It refers to how strongly a perception is felt or experienced.

Granularity: The level of detail or resolution in a perceptual experience. It indicates how finely the components of a perception are distinguished or perceived.

Cohesion: The degree to which different components of a perceptual experience are connected or integrated. It reflects how well the various elements of a perception fit together or form a coherent whole.

Control: The extent to which an individual can consciously influence or manipulate a perceptual experience. It refers to the ability to direct or change the nature of one's perceptions.

These dimensions provide a framework for understanding and describing the various aspects of perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.






You said:
Ok, now let's look at the interconnectedness of the various perceptual fields... one could perhaps say that this is the notion of cohesion applied to the entire taxonomy, or that cohesion is the notion of interconnectedness applied within the confines of one particular field of perception.


ChatGPT said:
In the context of the taxonomy of perceptual fields in RMS, interconnectedness refers to the degree to which the various perceptual fields influence and interact with each other. It can be seen as a broader concept than cohesion, which typically refers to the internal consistency or coherence within a single perceptual field.

Interconnectedness considers how different perceptual fields, such as sensory input, feelings, emotions, memories, and thoughts, are interrelated and affect each other. For example, a sensory experience may trigger an emotional response, which in turn influences thoughts and memories. Similarly, memories can shape our perceptions of current sensory experiences, leading to a complex web of interactions among the different perceptual fields.

Cohesion, on the other hand, may refer to the internal consistency or coherence within a single perceptual field. For instance, within the perceptual field of emotions, cohesion would describe how individual emotional experiences relate to each other and form a coherent emotional state.

In summary, interconnectedness in the context of the taxonomy of perceptual fields in RMS refers to the broader concept of how different perceptual fields influence and interact with each other, while cohesion may describe the internal consistency or coherence within a single perceptual field.

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) is a comprehensive epistemological framework that challenges traditional notions of certainty and extends into the nature of reality and human perception. Here's a detailed overview of its foundational principles:

PART I: THE RMS FRAMEWORK 

Equivalence Principle:
Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) introduces the Equivalence Principle as a foundational concept that challenges traditional epistemological assumptions. This principle posits that statements about the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. The Equivalence Principle serves as a lens through which RMS examines the nature of reality, emphasizing the inability to discern the validity of propositions regarding an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

The Equivalence Principle at the core of Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) posits that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. This principle asserts that such propositions, devoid of verifiable distinctions, lack meaningfulness. In essence, it is a restatement of the Law of Identity (A=A) as applied to larger philosophical concepts, emphasizing the inherent equality of propositions sharing the same evidential support and lacking predictive differentiation.

The foundational concept of the Equivalence Principle challenges traditional epistemological assumptions, particularly regarding propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. By asserting the indistinguishability of propositions with no differential predictions, RMS navigates the limitations of human knowledge and probes the meaningfulness of statements beyond immediate perceptual experiences.

Unknown vs. Unknowable:
In the RMS framework, the "unknown" refers to aspects beyond our immediate perceptual awareness. In contrast, the "unknowable" encompasses propositions positing anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. The Equivalence Principle is applied to these unknowable propositions, asserting their inherent indistinguishability and challenging their meaningfulness.

PART II: ESTABLISHING SHARED TRUTHS

Perceptual Fields Taxonomy:
RMS develops a taxonomy that organizes perceptual experiences along dimensions such as clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. It's crucial to clarify that this taxonomy is personal and subject to significant variation among individuals. The dimensions serve as a framework to enhance legibility in discussing personal experiences, providing a foundation for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. Examples like thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy illustrate the adaptable nature of the taxonomy, recognizing that individuals may construct their taxonomies differently.RMS encourages the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to accommodate diverse individual experiences. It recognizes that personal taxonomies will vary, allowing for discussion and exploration of shared truths within the framework. The taxonomy is not prescriptive but serves as a starting point for dialogue, demonstrating the flexibility needed to encompass the richness and diversity of human perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.

It is emphasized that any such taxonomy of perceptual experiences is a deeply individual exercize, and attempting to organize one's fields of perceptions is probably always going to be a rough-and-ready approximation that is successful insofar as it is personally useful, and insofar as it establishes shared language for talking about shared truths. 

For example, my idiosyncratic perceptual experience of Interpersonal Symmetry is introduced as an example to illustrate the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to reflect others' experiences. Another example might be the possibility of deepening or breaking out some of the perceptual fields identified, such as by charactarizing each sensory input type as its own perceptual experience, or removing or otherwise adapting some of them, as would likely be the case for someone who lacks sight or hearing, or in the case of powerful synasthesias. Everybody's personal taxonomy will look at least slightly, and perhaps profoundly different (e.g. in the case of the synasthete, numbers and colors, and mathematics might be deeply interconnected while they aren't for me, a deaf person might remove or re-classify hearing, perhaps adding echolocation; the point of the taxonomy is to try to establish more legible discussion of individuals' personal perceptual experiences, thereby opening the door to dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. The same sorts of considerations apply to the interrelatedness of the fields as I've indicated below in my personal taxonomy. 

What follows are two different rough-and-ready ways to create a personal taxonomy of perceptual fields.

The Various Perceptual Fields in my personal taxonomy:
Sensory Input
Feelings
Emotions
Perceptual Patterns
Memories
Logical errors/misunderstandings
Dreams
Dreamless Sleep
Hallucinatory Altered States
Illusions
Meditative Altered States
Thought
Logic
Interpersonal Synergy

Sensory Input [sight, sound, etc -- directly impinged upon my consciousness]: very clear, very granular, tightly and coherently interconnected, under very limited conscious control (e.g. through movement, physical manipulation), directly percieved
Feelings [pain, arousal, hunger, etc -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness]: fairly clear, moderately granular, modertately coherently interconnected, under somewhat conscious control (e.g. I can take a pain reliever, I can eat)
Emotions [joy, fear, anger -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness; may include thought-mediated emotional perceptions such as aesthetic experience]: moderately clear, less granular, less coherently interconnected, under somewhat limited consious control (e.g. with effort, I can do things like psyching myself up or calming myself down)
Perceptual Patterns [ingrained or learned notions about the integration between various senses, and the interconnections between the various perceptual fields -- indirectly percieved through thought, influenced by memory and reasoning; generally built up through patterns over time and as such time perception may be integral to or a subset of perceptual patterns, may also include less directly percieved associations such as synasthesia and intuition]: moderately granular, moderately coherent, under fairly limited conscious control (e.g. I have strong expectations about the world, but through thought I can sometimes change the framework of those expectations)
Memories [non-sensory simulacra of past experiences of the other perceptual fields, indirectly percieved through thought, sometimes through dreams]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Logical errors/misunderstandings [disconnections mispercieved as connections -- indirectly percieved through thought or memory]: variable clarity, variable coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can attempt to correct errors once brought to my attention, but otherwise I am largely unaware of the errors)
Dreams [non-sensory simulacra of experiences of the other perceptual fields, directly percieved through experience while sleeping, sometimes mixed with or influenced by sensory input recieved during sleep]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Dreamless sleep [almost entirely imperceptible experience characterized by the absence of other perceptual fields during sleep, though sometimes sensory, feelings, emotions, and memories can perturb this sense of disconnection from other perceptual fields]: absence of clarity, absence of granularity, coherent (in that the experience is substantially similar from night to night), characterized by the cessation of nearly all connection to other experience, under very limited conscious control (e.g. I can go to bed early, stay up late, set an alarm, etc)
Hallucinatory altered states [fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness, experienced as apparently direct impingement, sometimes mediated by thought, of hallucinatory sense experiences which seem to be perturbations or simulacara of other perceptual experiences]: variable clarity (sometimes radically heightened or lowered sense of clarity), highly variable granularity, highly variable interconnectedness and coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can choose to have hallucinations through ingestion of certain substances, but once the experience begins, I have a more tenuous amount of control over the perceptions impinging upon my consciousness, but this ability to control the simulacara of sensory input is noticably increased with respect to my control over normal sensory perception) 
Illusions [experienced as fairly directly impinging upon my sensory perceptions]: variable clarity, variable granularity, experienced as directly integrated into other sensory input but sometimes seem disconnected from the usual perceptual patterns I've learned through experiences and memories (and therefore often confusing) and frequently discontinuous or not coherent with other sensory input in the sense that the illusion usually seems temporary and can be broken, often under significant conscious control (e.g. some illusions can be broken and reformed with some degree of conscious effort) 
Meditative altered states [percieved alterations to our sense of connectedness to our various perceptual fields -- fairly directly impacting various perceptual fields, especially thought, emotion, pattern perception, and to a lesser degree sensory perception]: variable clarity (sometimes heightened clarity with respect to usual perceptual states), variable coherence, variable interconnectedness and connectedness with other perceptual fields, often achieved only through conscious exertion of effort or strenuous physical experience
Thought [seems to be the mediator for all of the other perceptual fields (in the sense that any brain activity can be called "thought", but while much of this thought is involuntary, barely percieved with effort, and under very limited conscious control, there is also conscious thought which is under a great degree of conscious control -- indirectly percieved as ideas and logic and reasoning, often about other perceptual fields and relatedness among them]: limited clarity, variable granularity, somewhat coherent, often under significant conscious control but often under limited or very limited conscious control
Logic [reasoning, mathematics, etc -- experienced as a heightened state of clarity within the perceptual experience of thought]: significantly enhanced clarity of thoughts, highly granular though often less granular than sensory perceptions, highly cohesive although usually only through significant conceptual effort, largely under conscious control and requires conscious effort to achieve and maintain
"Interpersonal Synergy". This is extremely heightened emotional excitement characterized by the shared experience of feeling a powerful, almost palpable emotional bond with another person. It has less clarity than does direct sensory perception, but much more clarity and concretenesss than most emotional perceptions. It is also characterized by significantly heightened granularity and complexity of the emotional experience, though again not as granular as sensory input. It also has a fairly strong sense of cohesiveness and interconnectedness compared to other emotional states, almost as cohesive as logical perceptions and even pattern awareness. This sensation is also characterized by a shift in thought patterns, reasoning, and to some extent, the peception of other perceptual fields, almost like a semi-persistent altered state of consciousness, with moderate and limited conscious control.

The Equivalence Principle is applied to unknowable propositions, highlighting their inherent indistinguishability and questioning their meaningfulness.

To establish shared truths within the RMS framework, a taxonomy of perceptual experiences is developed. This taxonomy organizes experiences along dimensions such as clarity, granularity, coherence, and control, recognizing that individual experiences may vary significantly. It serves as a framework for dialogue, allowing for the exploration of shared truths within the RMS framework while acknowledging the diversity of human perceptual experiences.

The RMS taxonomy categorizes perceptual experiences into various fields, including sensory input, feelings, emotions, perceptual patterns, memories, logical errors/misunderstandings, dreams, dreamless sleep, hallucinatory altered states, meditative altered states, thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy. Each field is characterized by its clarity, granularity, coherence, and level of conscious control, highlighting the complexity and richness of human perception.

In conclusion, RMS challenges traditional epistemological assumptions and offers a unique perspective on reality and human perception. By introducing the Equivalence Principle and developing a taxonomy of perceptual experiences, RMS provides a framework for exploring the limitations of human knowledge and the nature of shared truths within a deeply individual and subjective perceptual landscape.

Okay, now can you clean up and expand this overview into a comprehensive philosophical treatise introducing and explaining RMS and its rationale and use, providing clarifying examples? Understanding that this may be very long, and could stretch across multiple replies.

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) is a comprehensive epistemological framework that challenges traditional notions of certainty and extends into the nature of reality and human perception. Here's a detailed overview of its foundational principles:

PART I: THE RMS FRAMEWORK 

Equivalence Principle:
Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) introduces the Equivalence Principle as a foundational concept that challenges traditional epistemological assumptions. This principle posits that statements about the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. The Equivalence Principle serves as a lens through which RMS examines the nature of reality, emphasizing the inability to discern the validity of propositions regarding an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

The Equivalence Principle at the core of Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) posits that any two propositions consistent with identical evidence and lacking predictive distinctions are inherently indistinguishable. This principle asserts that such propositions, devoid of verifiable distinctions, lack meaningfulness. In essence, it is a restatement of the Law of Identity (A=A) as applied to larger philosophical concepts, emphasizing the inherent equality of propositions sharing the same evidential support and lacking predictive differentiation.

The foundational concept of the Equivalence Principle challenges traditional epistemological assumptions, particularly regarding propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. By asserting the indistinguishability of propositions with no differential predictions, RMS navigates the limitations of human knowledge and probes the meaningfulness of statements beyond immediate perceptual experiences.

Unknown vs. Unknowable:
In the RMS framework, the "unknown" refers to aspects beyond our immediate perceptual awareness. In contrast, the "unknowable" encompasses propositions positing anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. The Equivalence Principle is applied to these unknowable propositions, asserting their inherent indistinguishability and challenging their meaningfulness.

PART II: ESTABLISHING SHARED TRUTHS

Perceptual Fields Taxonomy:
RMS develops a taxonomy that organizes perceptual experiences along dimensions such as clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. It's crucial to clarify that this taxonomy is personal and subject to significant variation among individuals. The dimensions serve as a framework to enhance legibility in discussing personal experiences, providing a foundation for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. Examples like thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy illustrate the adaptable nature of the taxonomy, recognizing that individuals may construct their taxonomies differently.RMS encourages the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to accommodate diverse individual experiences. It recognizes that personal taxonomies will vary, allowing for discussion and exploration of shared truths within the framework. The taxonomy is not prescriptive but serves as a starting point for dialogue, demonstrating the flexibility needed to encompass the richness and diversity of human perceptual experiences within the RMS framework.

It is emphasized that any such taxonomy of perceptual experiences is a deeply individual exercize, and attempting to organize one's fields of perceptions is probably always going to be a rough-and-ready approximation that is successful insofar as it is personally useful, and insofar as it establishes shared language for talking about shared truths. 

For example, my idiosyncratic perceptual experience of Interpersonal Symmetry is introduced as an example to illustrate the expansion and adaptation of the taxonomy to reflect others' experiences. Another example might be the possibility of deepening or breaking out some of the perceptual fields identified, such as by charactarizing each sensory input type as its own perceptual experience, or removing or otherwise adapting some of them, as would likely be the case for someone who lacks sight or hearing, or in the case of powerful synasthesias. Everybody's personal taxonomy will look at least slightly, and perhaps profoundly different (e.g. in the case of the synasthete, numbers and colors, and mathematics might be deeply interconnected while they aren't for me, a deaf person might remove or re-classify hearing, perhaps adding echolocation; the point of the taxonomy is to try to establish more legible discussion of individuals' personal perceptual experiences, thereby opening the door to dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework. The same sorts of considerations apply to the interrelatedness of the fields as I've indicated below in my personal taxonomy. 

What follows are two different rough-and-ready ways to create a personal taxonomy of perceptual fields.

The Various Perceptual Fields in my personal taxonomy:
Sensory Input
Feelings
Emotions
Perceptual Patterns
Memories
Logical errors/misunderstandings
Dreams
Dreamless Sleep
Hallucinatory Altered States
Illusions
Meditative Altered States
Thought
Logic
Interpersonal Synergy

Sensory Input [sight, sound, etc -- directly impinged upon my consciousness]: very clear, very granular, tightly and coherently interconnected, under very limited conscious control (e.g. through movement, physical manipulation), directly percieved
Feelings [pain, arousal, hunger, etc -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness]: fairly clear, moderately granular, modertately coherently interconnected, under somewhat conscious control (e.g. I can take a pain reliever, I can eat)
Emotions [joy, fear, anger -- fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness; may include thought-mediated emotional perceptions such as aesthetic experience]: moderately clear, less granular, less coherently interconnected, under somewhat limited consious control (e.g. with effort, I can do things like psyching myself up or calming myself down)
Perceptual Patterns [ingrained or learned notions about the integration between various senses, and the interconnections between the various perceptual fields -- indirectly percieved through thought, influenced by memory and reasoning; generally built up through patterns over time and as such time perception may be integral to or a subset of perceptual patterns, may also include less directly percieved associations such as synasthesia and intuition]: moderately granular, moderately coherent, under fairly limited conscious control (e.g. I have strong expectations about the world, but through thought I can sometimes change the framework of those expectations)
Memories [non-sensory simulacra of past experiences of the other perceptual fields, indirectly percieved through thought, sometimes through dreams]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Logical errors/misunderstandings [disconnections mispercieved as connections -- indirectly percieved through thought or memory]: variable clarity, variable coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can attempt to correct errors once brought to my attention, but otherwise I am largely unaware of the errors)
Dreams [non-sensory simulacra of experiences of the other perceptual fields, directly percieved through experience while sleeping, sometimes mixed with or influenced by sensory input recieved during sleep]: variable clarity, less granular, moderately interconnected, significantly under conscious control (e.g. I can choose to remember some things and not others, and memories often impinge themselves into my consciousness without my concious choice)
Dreamless sleep [almost entirely imperceptible experience characterized by the absence of other perceptual fields during sleep, though sometimes sensory, feelings, emotions, and memories can perturb this sense of disconnection from other perceptual fields]: absence of clarity, absence of granularity, coherent (in that the experience is substantially similar from night to night), characterized by the cessation of nearly all connection to other experience, under very limited conscious control (e.g. I can go to bed early, stay up late, set an alarm, etc)
Hallucinatory altered states [fairly directly impinged upon my consciousness, experienced as apparently direct impingement, sometimes mediated by thought, of hallucinatory sense experiences which seem to be perturbations or simulacara of other perceptual experiences]: variable clarity (sometimes radically heightened or lowered sense of clarity), highly variable granularity, highly variable interconnectedness and coherence, under limited conscious control (e.g. I can choose to have hallucinations through ingestion of certain substances, but once the experience begins, I have a more tenuous amount of control over the perceptions impinging upon my consciousness, but this ability to control the simulacara of sensory input is noticably increased with respect to my control over normal sensory perception) 
Illusions [experienced as fairly directly impinging upon my sensory perceptions]: variable clarity, variable granularity, experienced as directly integrated into other sensory input but sometimes seem disconnected from the usual perceptual patterns I've learned through experiences and memories (and therefore often confusing) and frequently discontinuous or not coherent with other sensory input in the sense that the illusion usually seems temporary and can be broken, often under significant conscious control (e.g. some illusions can be broken and reformed with some degree of conscious effort) 
Meditative altered states [percieved alterations to our sense of connectedness to our various perceptual fields -- fairly directly impacting various perceptual fields, especially thought, emotion, pattern perception, and to a lesser degree sensory perception]: variable clarity (sometimes heightened clarity with respect to usual perceptual states), variable coherence, variable interconnectedness and connectedness with other perceptual fields, often achieved only through conscious exertion of effort or strenuous physical experience
Thought [seems to be the mediator for all of the other perceptual fields (in the sense that any brain activity can be called "thought", but while much of this thought is involuntary, barely percieved with effort, and under very limited conscious control, there is also conscious thought which is under a great degree of conscious control -- indirectly percieved as ideas and logic and reasoning, often about other perceptual fields and relatedness among them]: limited clarity, variable granularity, somewhat coherent, often under significant conscious control but often under limited or very limited conscious control
Logic [reasoning, mathematics, etc -- experienced as a heightened state of clarity within the perceptual experience of thought]: significantly enhanced clarity of thoughts, highly granular though often less granular than sensory perceptions, highly cohesive although usually only through significant conceptual effort, largely under conscious control and requires conscious effort to achieve and maintain
"Interpersonal Synergy". This is extremely heightened emotional excitement characterized by the shared experience of feeling a powerful, almost palpable emotional bond with another person. It has less clarity than does direct sensory perception, but much more clarity and concretenesss than most emotional perceptions. It is also characterized by significantly heightened granularity and complexity of the emotional experience, though again not as granular as sensory input. It also has a fairly strong sense of cohesiveness and interconnectedness compared to other emotional states, almost as cohesive as logical perceptions and even pattern awareness. This sensation is also characterized by a shift in thought patterns, reasoning, and to some extent, the peception of other perceptual fields, almost like a semi-persistent altered state of consciousness, with moderate and limited conscious control.

Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) represents a paradigm shift in epistemology, challenging conventional notions of certainty and delving into the depths of human perception and reality itself. At its core, RMS introduces the Equivalence Principle, which asserts that statements about the world beyond immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally true or false. This principle serves as a foundational concept, highlighting the limitations of human knowledge when it comes to propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

In the RMS framework, the distinction between the "unknown" and the "unknowable" is crucial. The "unknown" refers to aspects beyond our immediate perceptual awareness, while the "unknowable" encompasses propositions positing anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. The Equivalence Principle is applied to these unknowable propositions, emphasizing their inherent indistinguishability and questioning their meaningfulness.

To establish shared truths within the RMS framework, a taxonomy of perceptual experiences is developed. This taxonomy organizes experiences along dimensions such as clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. It's important to note that this taxonomy is deeply personal and subject to significant variation among individuals. Examples such as thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy illustrate the adaptability of the taxonomy, allowing for a richer understanding of individual perceptual experiences and facilitating dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework.

For instance, Nathan's personal taxonomy includes sensory input, feelings, emotions, perceptual patterns, memories, logical errors/misunderstandings, dreams, dreamless sleep, hallucinatory altered states, illusions, meditative altered states, thought, logic, and interpersonal synergy. Each category is described in terms of clarity, granularity, coherence, and control, highlighting the diverse and nuanced nature of human perception within the RMS framework.

By embracing RMS, individuals are encouraged to explore the complexities of their own perceptual experiences and engage in meaningful dialogue about the nature of reality and human understanding. This framework challenges us to rethink our assumptions about knowledge and certainty, opening up new avenues for philosophical inquiry and self-reflection.

Chapter 7: Radical Meta-Skepticism and the Nature of Reality

In the vast landscape of philosophical inquiry, Radical Meta-Skepticism (RMS) stands out as a bold and provocative framework that challenges the very foundations of traditional epistemology. At its heart lies the Equivalence Principle, a concept that redefines our understanding of certainty and truth. According to RMS, statements about the world beyond our immediate perceptual experiences are inherently indistinguishable, rendering them equally valid or invalid. This principle serves as a lens through which RMS examines the nature of reality, highlighting the limitations of human knowledge when it comes to propositions about an unknowable realm beyond conceivable perceptual awareness.

To grasp the essence of RMS, it is essential to distinguish between the "unknown" and the "unknowable." The "unknown" refers to aspects beyond our immediate perceptual awareness, while the "unknowable" encompasses propositions positing anything beyond conceivable perceptual awareness. RMS applies the Equivalence Principle to these unknowable propositions, challenging their meaningfulness and highlighting their inherent indistinguishability.

Establishing shared truths within the RMS framework requires a nuanced approach to understanding human perception. A taxonomy of perceptual experiences is developed, organizing experiences along dimensions such as clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. This taxonomy is deeply personal, acknowledging the significant variation in individual experiences. It provides a framework for dialogue about shared truths within the RMS framework, emphasizing the richness and diversity of human perceptual experiences.

Nathan's personal taxonomy offers a glimpse into the complexity of human perception within the RMS framework. From sensory input to interpersonal synergy, each category is described in terms of clarity, granularity, coherence, and control. This taxonomy serves as a starting point for individuals to explore and articulate their own perceptual experiences, fostering a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and human understanding.

Embracing RMS opens up new avenues for philosophical inquiry and self-reflection. It challenges us to rethink our assumptions about knowledge and certainty, inviting us to explore the depths of our own perceptual experiences. In doing so, RMS invites us to consider the profound implications of our limited understanding of reality and the fundamental nature of human existence.
