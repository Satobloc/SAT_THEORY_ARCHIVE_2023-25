Stringing Along Theory: Connecting Assembly, Bioelectricity, and Cognition
Yes, there appear to be several ways in which the core insight of Stringing Along Theory (SAT) – the physical connectedness of a particle's past, present, and future through continuous filaments, and the potential for cross-temporal force transmission along these filaments [1, 2] – might extend or offer new perspectives on questions raised by the work of Lee Cronin (Assembly Theory - AT) and Michael Levin (bioelectricity, cognition).
Regarding Lee Cronin's Assembly Theory (AT):
•
The Role of History and Contingency: AT emphasizes that the complexity of an object is defined by its assembly index, reflecting the historical steps required for its formation and the causal contingency involved [3-5]. SAT's core insight, with its focus on continuous filaments extending from the universe's origin [3, 5] and their cross-temporal interactions [1, 3, 6, 7], could provide a fundamental physical mechanism for this historical contingency. The specific configuration and interactions of filaments over time could dictate the pathways available for assembly at the chemical level that AT investigates. The "degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects" [5], as measured by AT's assembly index, might be rooted in the specific historical intertwining and force transmissions along the underlying filaments. SAT's framework suggests that what exists is influenced by the entire four-dimensional history of its constituent filaments [1, 3], potentially offering a deeper explanation for the historical dependence that AT identifies as crucial [3-5].
•
Emergence of Complexity: AT aims to understand how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint [5]. SAT proposes that complexity arises from the interactions and intertwining of fundamental filaments across spacetime [3, 5, 8, 9]. The core insight of cross-temporal connectivity and force transmission could be critical in understanding how simple filaments organize into increasingly complex structures over time. The "assembly spaces" within AT [5] could be constrained or enabled by the specific cross-temporal interactions and forces mediated by the underlying filamental network, providing a foundational layer for the emergence of complex chemical objects.
Regarding Michael Levin's work on bioelectricity and cognition:
•
Emergence of Complex Behaviors and Intelligence:Levin's research explores how complex behaviors, decision-making, and goal-directed activity arise in biological systems from the interactions of lower-level components, often involving bioelectric signaling [3, 10-15]. SAT's core insight, suggesting that even consciousness and thought arise from cross-temporal filament interactions [3, 16-19] and that forces can be transmitted along these filaments [1, 2], could offer a novel perspective on the physical basis of information processing within biological systems. Bioelectric signals, which Levin studies extensively [12-15], might be a higher-level manifestation of the more fundamental cross-temporal interactions and force transmissions occurring at the filamental level. SAT could potentially provide a framework for understanding how information and influence propagate through biological systems across scales, linking molecular interactions to collective behaviors through the underlying four-dimensional connectivity of filaments.
•
Observer-Dependent Nature of Cognition: Levin emphasizes that the level of cognition attributed to a system is observer-dependent [3, 13, 15]. SAT explicitly integrates the observer into its framework, suggesting that all knowledge is subjective and mediated by perceptual constructs modeled as cross-temporal filament structures [3, 16-18, 20]. This alignment in recognizing the role of the observer is significant. SAT's core insight, particularly the idea that communication and conceptual transfer occur through the interaction and intertwining of filament structures [18, 19], could offer a fundamental physical basis for how different observers, with their unique filamental configurations representing their internal models of reality, can interact and develop shared understandings (or fail to do so). The subjectivity of knowledge in SAT [17, 18, 20] could be rooted in the specific cross-temporal structuring of filaments within each observer.
•
Collective Intelligence and Agency: Levin's work investigates collective intelligence in cellular systems and the ability of these systems to solve problems [3, 21-25]. SAT's concept of interconnected filaments [26-30] and the possibility of cross-temporal force transmission [1, 2] could provide a framework for understanding how individual biological components (perhaps related to filament intersections or configurations) can coordinate their actions over time and exhibit emergent collective behaviors. The "competency" of cells and tissues that Levin describes [13] might be facilitated by underlying cross-temporal communication and influence mediated by the filamental network, allowing for coordinated responses to perturbations and problem-solving at a multicellular level.
In summary, SAT's core insight of physically connected filaments across time with the capacity for cross-temporal force transmission offers potential avenues for extending and providing a more fundamental physical basis for the historical contingency and emergence of complexity observed in Cronin's Assembly Theory, as well as the emergence of complex behaviors, the observer-dependent nature of cognition, and collective intelligence studied by Levin. While SAT is a speculative framework [31, 32], its radical idea of cross-temporal connectivity could offer novel perspectives on these diverse areas of scientific inquiry.

Emergence, History, and Unification: Cronin, Levin, and McKnight
Yes, there appear to be several potential connections between the works of Lee Cronin (Assembly Theory - AT), Michael Levin (bioelectricity, cognition), and Nathan McKnight (Stringing Along Theory - SAT), although they operate at vastly different scales and address different phenomena. Here's a breakdown of some possible connections:
•
Emergence of Complexity: Both Assembly Theory and Stringing Along Theory offer frameworks for understanding how complexity arises from more fundamental components or processes.
◦
Assembly Theory (AT) posits that the complexity of an "object" is defined by its assembly index, which is the number of steps on a minimal path to produce it, capturing the historical contingency of its formation [1, 2]. This suggests that complex entities arise through specific construction histories.
◦
Stringing Along Theory (SAT) proposes that the complexity of the universe, including particles, matter, and even thought, emerges from the interactions and intertwining of fundamental filaments across spacetime [3-5]. More complex structures like threads, twines, and yarns are formed through the combination of filaments [3].
◦
Michael Levin's work also touches upon the emergence of complex behaviors, such as decision-making and goal-directed activity, in biological systems ranging from cells to animal collectives [6, 7]. His research explores how these complex capabilities arise from the interactions of lower-level components, often involving bioelectric signaling [8-11].
•
The Role of History and Contingency: Assembly Theory explicitly incorporates the historical contingency of an object's formation into its definition and measure of assembly [1, 2]. What exists is influenced by history and causal contingency [1]. Similarly, while SAT is a cosmological framework, the idea that filaments extend from the origin of the universe [3] and that their interactions across time contribute to present phenomena [12, 13] implies a role for historical development in shaping the current state of the universe and its constituents. Levin's work in developmental biology is inherently concerned with how the history of a biological system's development leads to its current form and function [6].
•
Beyond Reductionism: Both AT and SAT, in their own ways, suggest that understanding phenomena requires more than just analyzing their basic components at a single point in time.
◦
AT argues that the assembly history is crucial for understanding an object's complexity and evidence of selection [1, 2].
◦
SAT posits that the four-dimensional extent and cross-temporal interactions of filaments are essential for understanding particles, forces, and even consciousness [4, 14, 15].
◦
Levin's focus on collective intelligence and the ability of cellular systems to solve problems in physiological space [16-18] suggests that emergent properties and system-level dynamics are crucial and cannot be fully predicted from individual cellular components alone.
•
Integration of the Observer/Subjectivity: While Assembly Theory's focus is primarily on quantifying the complexity of objects, SAT explicitly integrates the observer into its framework.
◦
SAT suggests that all knowledge is inherently subjective, mediated by perceptual constructs shared through language, which are themselves modeled as cross-temporal filament structures [15, 19-21]. This aligns with Eric Weinstein's concerns about the role of the observer in physics, which SAT aims to address [22-24].
◦
Levin's work also highlights the observer-dependent nature of cognition, stating that the level of cognition attributed to a system depends on the observer's ability to interact with and model that system [25]. Competency itself is defined in relation to an observer's ability to detect a system's problem-solving capabilities [16].
•
Search for Unifying Frameworks: All three areas of work seem to be motivated, at least in part, by a desire for more unified understandings.
◦
AT aims to create a unified language for describing selection across physics and biology [2].
◦
SAT attempts a "re-geometricization" of physics to provide a conceptually unified framework for understanding fundamental forces, matter, and consciousness [22-24, 26].
◦
Levin's research seeks to identify fundamental principles governing intelligence and agency across diverse substrates and scales [6, 27].
It is important to note that these are conceptual connections, and the specific mechanisms and scales of analysis differ significantly between these lines of inquiry. However, the underlying themes of emergence, the importance of history, the need to move beyond simple reductionism, the role of the observer (in some cases), and the pursuit of more unified understandings suggest potential areas of resonance between the works of Cronin, Levin, and the speculative framework of SAT.
