Stringing Along Theory (SAT)
A slightly tongue-in-cheek "toy theory" meant to explore the act of theorymaking, and open up more creative approaches.


SAT is a speculative framework that visualizes the universe as a four-dimensional structure, with time represented as a three-dimensional 'surface' propagating outward from a central point at the time of the big bang. Fundamental entities in SAT are called filaments, which extend radially from this central point and intersect the time surface at various points, representing elementary particles. Filaments give rise to matter and energy particles through their intersections with the time surface.

ELEMENTARY STRUCTURES
- The Time Surface: The four-dimensionally expanding wavefront of time (or spacetime), the three-dimensional surface of which we experience as "now". 
- Filaments: Stringlike entities intersecting the time surface, giving rise to elementary particles. Bosons (like photons and gluons) and fermions (like quarks and electrons) are the intersectional points of filaments with the time surface. Complex braiding rules for filaments should be derivable from Standard Model forces and other conventional particle physics models because these particle interactions are manifestations of the 4-dimensional structures of various multi-filament composite strands. Filaments form structures and interact with one another, giving rise to the stronger of the fundamental forces (strong, weak, electromagnetism, and quantum behaviors). Filaments also tug on each other in four dimensions, giving rise to gravity and gravito-quantum effects, which are produced by the tugs of strings upon each other, and probably the tugs exerted upon the strings and the time surface and vice-versa. These various tugs give rise to effects that can be seen both forwards and backwards along the time dimension. Gravity is seen as an emergent force, the sum total of all of the tugs exerted upon a gravitationally-interacting system as a result of present, past, and future interactions between filaments and the various composite strands they form.
  
COMPOSITE STRANDS
- Threads: Composites of filaments tightly intertwined across 4-space. Mesons and baryons (protons and neutrons) are the 3-space structures resulting from the intersection of threads with the time surface.
- Twines: More complicated structures resulting from the intertwining of threads. Atoms are the 3d manifestation of 4d twines.
- Yarns: Larger 4d structures formed by the binding of multiple twines. Twines (atoms) braid together in four dimensions to form yarns (molecules). 
- Bundles: Four-dimensional yarns may become physically bound together in bundles, the 4d equivalent of interacting molecular systems. Essentially, these are the 4d extensions of everyday objects and other small, discrete bodies not pulled into gravitational spheres. Everything from small asteroids and comets to rocks and man-made objects arise from bundles. They may be tightly cohesive or more loosely intertwined networks of yarns, and typically they will be interconnected by networks of yarns interwoven between multiple bundles. Organisms themselves could be seen as a very special type of bundle, or bundle systems characterized by many yarns woven together into somewhat persistent 4d patterns, even though the specific yarns forming the pattern may change along its four-dimensional extent, the patten persists until the death of the organism, which by the time it disperses, may be woven from totally different yarns than those that came together to form it in the first place. 

STRAND COMPLEXES
- Ropes: Large, cohesive groups of intertwined bundles. The 3d equivalent are spheroidal, gravitationally cohesive bodies like planets and stars. Ropes take on various morphologies in four dimensions, including heloids, loops, and tethers. These rope morphologies manifest as dynamic gravitational systems, such as stable orbital systems (heloids) and larger bodies not gravitationally bound to primary bodies (loops/tethers). Smaller strand structures also take on these morphologies (e.g. small bodies like asteroids and comets, and even filaments themselves).


Predictions:

SAT predicts unexpected correlations between particle interaction density, frequency, or intensity within gravitationally-bound systems and the gravitational behavior of those systems.
It suggests possible interpretations of dark energy as arising from properties of the propagating time surface and its interaction with evolving string configurations.
SAT implies that there may be unique particle interactions or behaviors that can only be explained by the properties of filaments and their interactions with the time surface, leading to variation in the basic quantum properties of particles over time.
Testing SAT:

Direct observation of dark matter, or strong evidence for its nature and structure, would require significant reworking of SAT's foundational assumptions.
Observations of unexpected correlations between particle interaction density and gravitational behavior within gravitationally-bound systems would confirm SAT's predictions.

SAT is an abstraction intended as a heuristic for predicting properties of the universe, not as an assertion of the true nature of the universe. It accommodates various geometries beyond the spherical expansion of the time surface and remains open to revision based on empirical evidence and theoretical development.
