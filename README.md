This is basically a personal archive and indexing system for my own use, so that I can access my files more conveniently. 
That said, it's also an idea that anybody is welcome to consider, share, and work with.
Started very small, and only grew because once the original ontological commitments were established, so many other things fell into place. Naturally, intuitively. 
If you decide to make use of this material, feel free to strike up a conversation. It's been a lot to work on for a long time, and it's about time it had a public face. 
This is the start. 

================================================================================
CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SCALAR–ANGULAR THEORY (SAT)
(Canonical Name: Scalar–Angular Theory or Scalar–Angular Torsion Theory)
================================================================================

I. PHASE 0: CONCEPTUAL AND PROTO-THEORY STAGE (c. 1993 – c. 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This period encompasses the initial geometric intuitions and unstructured naming conventions that preceded formal axiomatic development.

*   C. 1993 – 2010 : EARLIEST CONCEPTS
    *   Moleskin sketches [Query] (unnamed, misinterpreted understandings of String Theory).
*   C. 2022 : FILAMENT HYPOTHESIS
    *   Introduction of the term "**Filament**" [Query].
    *   Nickname: "**stringing-along theory**" (led to the SAT acronym) [Query].
*   EARLY FORMALIZATION ATTEMPTS
    *   Proposed Alternate Name: **Chronophysical Structure** [Query].
    *   Earliest Module Formats (Recalled): **Module A, Module B, Module 0A, Module 0B** [Query].

II. PHASE I: NUMBERED AND TRANSITIONAL VERSIONS (c. 2022 – MAY 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This phase saw the beginning of version tracking and the shift toward establishing the core geometry (SAT 4D foundation).

*   SAT VERSION TRACKING INITIATION
    *   First Explicit "New Version": **SAT 2.0** [Query, 374, 393, 401, 410, 551].
    *   Intermediate Versions: **SAT 2.5** [Query, 551].
    *   Roman Numeral Versions: **SAT Mark II – V** (and **III.5, V.5**) [Query, 401].
    *   Descriptive Sector Labels: **.4D** (4D-native formulation) or **.QM** (Quantum Mechanics sector) [Query, 393, 417].
    *   Arbitrary/Transitional Labels: **SAT X**, **SAT XY**, **SAT Y** (used when version count was lost) [Query, 374, 393, 401, 551]; **SAT Next**, **SAT Edge** [Query, 374, 551].

III. PHASE II: MODULAR RIGOR AND 4D ARCHITECTURE (SAT O / SAT 4D) (c. JUNE 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This phase established the methodological lock-in, enforcing **Interpretive Mode 1 (True Block)** (static 4D structure, dynamics are emergent projections). The modules (SAT.O#) define the core theory spine.

*   **JUN 2025** : ARCHITECTURAL & AXIOMATIC LOCK
    *   **SAT.O0** (Foundations Sanity Pass) proves the theory depends on **exactly two dimensional constants** (filament tension $T$ and length scale $L$).
    *   **SAT.O0-A** (Interpretive Modes and Development Road-Map) formally defines **Mode 1 (True Block)**, **Mode 2 (Semi-Dynamic Block)**, and **Mode 3 (Solidification Front)**.
    *   **SAT.O1** (4D Hyperhelical Filament Dynamics) is established as a **Rewritten 4D Draft**. It establishes that the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ emerges statistically from filament tangent vectors $\langle v_\mu v_\nu \rangle$.
    *   **SAT.O3** (Gauge Symmetries from Topology) is finalized as a **Rewritten 4D Draft**, deriving U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) from stable topological interlocks.
    *   **SAT.O4** (Predictive Falsifiability) is finalized as a **Rewritten 4D Draft**, including the constraint that **no stable particles should exist with topological charge $Q \ge 4$** (2/3 filament theorem).
    *   **SAT.O8** (Topological Mass Suppression) is established as an **Original 4D Draft** placeholder analysis for mass hierarchy via $Q$ suppression.
*   **JUN 10, 2025** : EMERGENT TIME, ENTROPY, AND COSMOLOGY SECTIONS
    *   **fSECTION 2** (Topological Origins of Entropy, Time Arrow, and Locus of Perception) is drafted, linking entropy growth to local topological complexity.
    *   **cSECTION 12** (Topological Foundations of Thermodynamics).
    *   **xSECTION 23** (Topological Foundations of Black Holes).
*   **ONGOING MODULES (Requires Rewrite/Redevelopment):**
    *   **SAT.O2** (Emergent Gravitational Action).
    *   **SAT.O5** (Emergent Gauge Couplings).
    *   **SAT.O6** (Unified Action).
    *   **SAT.O7** (Temporal Field $\theta_4(x)$) is explicitly flagged as **TENTATIVE/SPECULATIVE** and needs full redevelopment, including rigorous derivation of $g_{\mu\nu}$ from $\theta_4$ strain.

IV. PHASE III: STRUCTURAL CLOSURE AND CURRENT BUILD (LATE 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This phase focuses on the integration of modular results into the unified Lagrangian and quantitative validation against empirical data.

*   **PHASE VIII-A EXECUTION** (Structural Closure)
    *   **Goal Achieved:** All foundational gaps from SAT.O1–O8 are resolved, leading to the **first fully locked version of SAT’s foundational structure**.
    *   **Key Results Locked:** Computation of topological class $Q$ (winding + linking + writhe); Visualization of $\theta_4(x)$ (misalignment angle) and $S_{\mu\nu}$ (strain tensor).
*   **CURRENT BUILD: SAT/BLOCKWAVE**
    *   The theory is synthesized into the **"One–Action SAT"** (Blockwave Lagrangian), using only four fundamental field ontologies: $g_{\mu\nu}, u^\mu, \theta, J^{\mu\nu}$.
    *   The Lagrangian includes the **compact scalar phase $\theta$** with a cosine potential ($\mathcal{L}_\theta \propto 1-\cos\theta$), which is the critical architecture for mass generation and quantization.
*   **QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING** (Ongoing)
    *   Numerical constraints on parameters are computed using publicly available data, such as **CMB birefringence measurements** and **INTEGRAL 511 keV line/continuum ratio**.
    *   The quantitative structure of the compact sector is finalized, including torsion stiffness ($\kappa_0$) and the resulting **numerically grounded SAT particle spectrum table** (e.g., electron, muon, neutrinos, W/Z).

*   **COSMOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK**
    *   **PGCU** (Projection Geometry Cosmological Unfolding) module is used, interpreting cosmic expansion as the geometric sweeping of the time surface $\Sigma_t$ through the structure. The ultimate reality is often interpreted using **Mode 3 (Solidification Front)**.

*   **DEVELOPER MAXIM (GUIDING PRINCIPLE):**
    *   "**Freeze the block. Move the slice. Structure first. Dynamics emergent. Expand only when structure is sound.**".
    *   **Slogan:** "**MASS IS MISALIGNMENT. CHARGE IS TWIST. GRAVITY IS STRAIN. MOTION IS SLICING.**".
