Here is a potential logical structure derived from the source text:
Axiomatic Foundations (The Fundamental Entities):
1.
Existence of 4D Worldlines: The "real world" consists of particle worldlines plotted in four dimensions [0th]. These are referred to as filaments [0th].
2.
Existence of a Time Wavefront: Time moves as a wavefront through these worldlines [1st]. This is called the time surface [1st].
3.
Physical Reality of 4D Structures: The 4-dimensional extent of a particle's worldline (filament) and the time wavefront are physical objects [5th].
4.
Fundamental Interaction: There is a real interaction between the time wavefront and the filaments [3rd]. This interaction involves the transfer of energy, possibly in both directions [3rd].
Postulates Regarding Interactions and Their Consequences:
1.
Particle Perception: What is perceived as a fundamental particle is the intersection of a filament with the time wavefront [2nd].
2.
Interaction Governs Particles: These interactions (between the wavefront and filaments) govern particle formation and stability [4th].
3.
Interactions Exert Force Back: These interactions exert a force back on the wavefront [5th].
4.
Back-Transmission Creates Curvature: This back-transmission of energy from the filament network creates curvature of the time surface [6th].
Claims Regarding Existing Physics (Pillars and Propositions):
1.
Standard Model (SM) Importation: The entirety of the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) is treated as essentially accurate and will be fully imported into SAT with little or no change, apart from conceptual translation into the geometry of SAT [PILLAR NUMBER ONE, PROPOSITION A]. The SM describes the evolving 3D structure of everything [PILLAR NUMBER ONE]. The universe's structure can be viewed metaphorically as a complex, structured fabric of reality, giving intuitive insights into phenomena [PILLAR NUMBER ONE].
2.
General Relativity (GR) Derivation/Importation: The back-pull of the filament structure on the time surface creates curvatures of the time surface that re-create the curved spacetime of General Relativity very naturally from within SAT [PILLAR NUMBER TWO]. GR is treated as essentially correct and is fully importable into SAT's construction, requiring only conceptual translations into the geometry of SAT [PROPOSITION B].
3.
Quantum Mechanics (QM) Importation: The entirety of quantum mechanics is treated as essentially correct and is fully importable into SAT with little or no change, apart from conceptual translation into the geometry of SAT [PILLAR NUMBER THREE].
4.
String Theory (ST) Relation: Depending on the exact geometry of intersections, various interpretations of String Theory might be seen as a successful partial-mapping of SAT's geometry, potentially allowing some versions of ST to be imported with minimal changes apart from translation [PROPOSITION F].
Explanations of Physical Phenomena within SAT Geometry:
1.
Particle Properties and Families: The interaction between the time surface and filaments likely encode all observed particle properties and families, directly mapping to the SM [9th]. Particle behaviors are probably described by their intersectional geometry with the wavefront [9th].
2.
Mass: The gross or absolute angle of intersection (theta_4) is considered a primary contributor to imparting mass, viewed as an energetic transfer from the wavefront to the filaments; greater angle means more energy transferred and more mass instantiated at the intersection [9th].
3.
Particle Interaction Laws (e.g., QCD, Spin, Flavor): The exact geometry of intersection depends on filament behavior, which is currently treated analogously to vibrating guitar strings [PILLAR NUMBER FOUR]. Intersectional traces over time should produce helical patterns [PILLAR NUMBER FOUR]. SAT interprets SM particle interaction laws as the result of these geometric morphologies, such as coil- or twist-locking mechanisms for QCD, and other morphologies for spin and flavor [PILLAR NUMBER FOUR]. Identifying these structures should give insights into property relationships [PILLAR NUMBER FOUR].
4.
Forces and Bosons (e.g., Light): Light and other forces/bosons are likely not truly particulate, but phenomena arising from force transfer across the filament network by the fermionic filaments themselves [PROPOSITION D]. Light is modeled as an "energy transfer release valve," a ripple in the filament network triggered by excessive energy absorption from the wavefront [PROPOSITION D].
5.
The Vacuum: The vacuum is filled with an aligned lattice of filaments with a near-zero or very low angle of intersection with the time surface [PROPOSITION E]. This low misalignment results in little energy transfer from the time surface to the vacuum filament network [PROPOSITION E]. Light travels through the vacuum as localized excitation waves roughly perpendicular to the aligned filaments [PROPOSITION E, i]. Multiple vacuum states may arise from the average regional intersection angle [PROPOSITION E, ii].
6.
Matter-Vacuum Continuum: Both mass-bearing particles and the vacuum filament lattice are made of the same fundamental structures interacting differently with the time surface [KEY INSIGHT]. Both vacuum and matter exist along a single continuum defined by the local landscape of the intersectional array [KEY INSIGHT].
7.
Fundamental Constants: Fundamental physical constants should be natural and intuitive implications of the SAT geometry or emergent phenomena [10th]. Their nature and value should be explainable by identifying the structural implications of the geometry, such as tension limits or torsional limits for constants like the Fine Structure Constant and Planck Constants [10th].
Constraints and Limits:
1.
Forward/Backward Forces: Forces are transferred along each filament's 4D extent, both futureward and pastward, creating the possibility of the future affecting the present and vice-versa [5th, 7th].
2.
Limits on Backward Propagation: The structure and properties of filaments (tensions, tensile strength, flexibility limits) and the time surface create an intuitive understanding of the limits of these "backbleed" effects [6th]. Backward propagation in time is structurally self-limiting by SAT geometry [6th]. This self-limitation is "baked in" to every interaction [6th]. This mechanism is proposed to naturally prevent causality violations, except possibly at very fine (perhaps quantum) scales [6th]. This could account for the "weird" aspects of quantum physics [6th].
Predictions:
1.
Explanation of Deviations: Known observational deviations from the Standard Model, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics may be explainable by general principles derived intuitively from the geometry of SAT [8th].
2.
Observable Anomalies from Past-Future Tensions: The tensions exerted upon the past by the future and the future by the past are not accounted for in the Standard Model, General Relativity, or Quantum Mechanics [PRIME GENERAL PREDICTION PATHWAY]. This is considered a blind spot likely to produce observable anomalies in the actual behavior of physical systems [PRIME GENERAL PREDICTION PATHWAY].
