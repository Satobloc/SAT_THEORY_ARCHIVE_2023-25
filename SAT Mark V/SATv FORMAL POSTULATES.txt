Immediate Next Step: Define the Visual Postulates
You‚Äôve already said this should come first. I agree. It‚Äôs the spine of the theory.

Let‚Äôs write them together‚Äîone by one.

These are not equations, but they are axioms in the classical sense: rules for how the universe is assumed to behave, described geometrically.

We can start with something like:

SAT-W / Temporally-Continuous Geometry Postulates (Draft 1)
Time is a propagating wavefront.
The present moment is the leading edge of a three-dimensional wave propagating through a four-dimensional lattice of filaments.

Filaments are continuous physical structures.
Filaments are continuous physical structures that pre-exist the wavefront and span the four-dimensional substrate. As the wavefront propagates, it intersects these filaments.
Only filaments that are sufficiently misaligned with the direction of wavefront propagation receive enough energy transfer to manifest as particles.
This interaction occurs when angular deviation causes a form of geometric ‚Äúdrag‚Äù or resistance, converting the wavefront‚Äôs propagation into filament excitation. Intersections with low angular deviation do not yield particles, and instead contribute to the background lattice of spacetime.


Angular interaction defines energy transfer.
The energy imparted by the wavefront to a filament is a function of the angle Œ∏ between the filament‚Äôs orientation and the wavefront‚Äôs direction of propagation:
E ‚àù sin¬≤(Œ∏) (or another form we may refine).

Matter arises from entangled or misaligned filaments.
Postulate 3 ‚Äî Mass as Angular Drag from Wavefront Propagation
Filaments that are misaligned with the direction of the propagating time wavefront experience drag‚Äîa geometric form of resistance that results in energy transfer from the wavefront to the filament.

This energy transfer is proportional to the filament‚Äôs angular deviation (Œ∏) from the wavefront‚Äôs propagation vector. When this angular misalignment crosses a critical threshold, the energy imparted becomes persistent, resulting in localized excitation:
mass.

Mathematically expressed (in draft form):
E(Œ∏) ‚àù sin¬≤(Œ∏)
Mass ‚âà cumulative energy deposition from repeated or sustained drag

üß© Implications:
Massless particles (e.g. photons) = filaments perfectly aligned with the wavefront; minimal to no drag; no persistent energy retention.

Massive particles = filaments whose orientation creates continuous or oscillating angular resistance; energy accumulates and stabilizes as rest mass.

Mass is local, but its source is distributed‚Äîa function of global filament orientation and wavefront geometry.

We could also add a corollary or companion rule:

Corollary: Local mass density is a function of angular deviation field intensity
Regions with dense concentrations of highly misaligned filaments will manifest greater curvature (gravity), more matter, and slower apparent passage of time‚Äîrecovering GR-like behavior from SAT-W structure.


Stable, complex interactions‚Äîsuch as braiding, coiling, or bundling‚Äîcreate the persistent structures we observe as particles and composite objects.

Forces are not objects, but structural transitions.
What we call bosons (force carriers) are not filaments but ripples‚Äîlocalized reconfigurations in filament geometry between intersections.

Space is not empty.
The ‚Äúvoid‚Äù is composed of aligned filaments parallel to the wavefront. They absorb minimal energy and manifest as vacuum, but they are physically real and structurally active.

Conservation is geometric.
Momentum, energy, and information are conserved through the continuous structure and tension of the filament network. These principles may not always appear local from within the wavefront, but are preserved across the 4D lattice.
