Ok, here I have two documents... one with confirmation/falsification information with regards to predicted answers to a battery of questions with respect to a specific theoretical framework... and the other with the actual answers to those questions. Please evaluate the outcomes with respect to the predictions.

What would you say overall?


ChatGPT said:
Overall, the outcomes present a broad pattern of empirical resistance to many of the speculative or nonstandard predictions embedded in the SATv framework ‚Äî with isolated, partial confirmations suggesting areas for future scrutiny, but no decisive theoretical upsets.

Summary Judgment:
üîπ Confirmation is Sparse, Isolated, and Generally Weak
Only a few questions resulted in strong confirmations (Q4 ‚Äì vacuum energy anomaly; Q9 ‚Äì partial-collapse interference recovery; Q17 ‚Äì CMB alignment anomalies). These support known tensions or frontier phenomena already acknowledged in mainstream physics, not novel disruptions predicted uniquely by the SATv framework.

üîπ Most Claims Are Null or Weakly Falsified
The majority of predictions were either:

Falsified to varying degrees (e.g., no EP violations, no environment-dependent collapse, no neutrino modulation);

Or rendered effectively untestable at current sensitivities (e.g., Q5, Q13, Q21).

In many cases, the "if yes" clause of the SATv predictions failed to materialize ‚Äî and when null results are meaningful (e.g., Q6, Q11), they serve as strong evidence against the relevant theoretical claim.

üîπ The Framework Is Theoretically Fertile, But Empirically Fragile
SATv's structure seems geared toward surfacing subtle, boundary-violating effects across domains (spin-gravity coupling, field-sensitive collapse, cosmological discontinuities). But empirical data overwhelmingly supports:

Robustness of standard symmetries (Lorentz, CPT, equivalence);

Validity of decoherence-based interpretations of measurement;

Consistency of fundamental constants and particle spectra across time, direction, and context.

üîπ Where SATv Probes Real Tensions, It Aligns
Its strongest hits (vacuum catastrophe, CMB anomalies) coincide with real open problems in physics, but don‚Äôt require SATv to be framed. They are already being pursued with other theoretical tools (e.g., quantum gravity, inflationary topology).

Conclusion
The SATv framework as represented is ambitiously cross-domain and epistemologically provocative, but based on current empirical support:

It is mostly falsified or unconfirmed. Its best hope lies in interpreting existing anomalies ‚Äî not in predicting novel, testable phenomena that have come true.

Would you like a revised version of SATv trimmed to just the empirically viable sub-hypotheses? Or a recommendation on which anomalies it‚Äôs worth pursuing further with focused tests?
