📌 SAT Wavefront Properties: Summary of Current Formulation
🔷 CORE PROPERTIES (SAT Ontological Commitments)
#	Property	Description
1	Direction of travel defines arrow of time	The wavefront moves unidirectionally across the filament network. Its progression defines causality and temporal flow. There is no “backward pass” or retrocausality.
2	Filament–wavefront intersections generate matter	At the point of intersection, angular resonance conditions may stabilize and yield observable particles (e.g., electrons, quarks). These are persistent topological excitations formed by the interaction geometry.

These are not negotiable within SAT—they define the ontology of observation and the generation of physical structure.

🟡 TENTATIVE PROPERTIES (SAT Working Hypotheses)
#	Property	Description
3	Wavefront carries energy	The wavefront is not just a clocking surface but a dynamic carrier of energy, tension, or angular impulse—enough to “activate” resonances.
4	Energy transfer is selective	Not all filaments absorb equally—some take up more energy depending on local configuration.
5	Selectivity gives rise to particle type	The kind of elementary particle created (mass, charge, spin) depends on how the wavefront imparts energy: likely dependent on filament curvature, twist, and angle.
6	Wavefront–filament drag defines mass	More “drag” (or resonance hold) → more mass. Drag might reflect energy retained within the filament as angular stress post-intersection.
7	Drag/selectivity determined by angle/twist	Angular mismatch or alignment between wavefront and filament determines whether resonance is strong (massive) or weak (light).
8	Vacuum corresponds to zero or low-energy interaction	Where filaments align in a null mode, the wavefront passes with no intersection or energy transfer: perceived as vacuum.
9	Light = energy not absorbed by mass creation	If energy is “excess” at a non-resonant site, it propagates as a released angular packet—i.e., a photon.

🔧 What We Can Start Building from This
📐 Formal Model Suggestions
The wavefront could be described as a null-like or tension-sweeping surface that carries an angular gradient field (e.g., 
Θ
(
𝑥
⃗
,
𝑡
)
Θ( 
x
 ,t)).

Intersections happen when filament angular alignment matches a local condition on the wavefront—e.g.:

Θ
(
𝑥
⃗
)
⋅
𝑇
⃗
filament
(
𝑥
⃗
)
>
𝜏

Θ( 
x
 )⋅ 
T

Where 
𝑇
⃗
T
  is filament twist direction and 
𝜏
res
τ 
res
​
  is a resonance threshold.

💡 Modeling Mass as Drag
Post-interaction angular mismatch could be defined as residual torsion, which resists re-alignment on future wavefront passes.

This residual could serve as inertial mass, proportional to the “twist hold” of the filament post-encounter.

📶 Vacuum Energy and Light
Regions of filament equilibrium or anti-resonance = vacuum.

Regions of near-resonance but not trapped = photon emission.

🧭 Next Step Candidates
Would you like to:

Diagram the interaction geometry of the wavefront with three sample filament states (e.g., null-pass, mass creation, photon release)?

Develop a mathematical structure for drag-like resonance mismatch that could define mass?

Attempt to derive a distribution function for wavefront energy transfer across filament orientations?

All are ready to go from this foundation.
