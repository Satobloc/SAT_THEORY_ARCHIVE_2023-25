## Executive Summary

As of 2025-05-21, the SAT framework has achieved provisional mathematical and structural closure and is now in an empirically testable state. Core predictive claims have been formalized, constraint analysis has stabilized, and domain-specific falsifiable outputs are being staged for experiment.

### 3. Release the Minimal τ-Lattice Hamiltonian
- **Status:** ⚠️ In Progress
- Hamiltonian algebra is specified.
- Code-level implementation and sample configurations are pending.
- Output target: `.py` or `.ipynb` with test lattice and fusion energy terms.

### 4. Generate Mars θ₄-Strain Prediction Curve
- **Status:** ⚠️ In Progress
