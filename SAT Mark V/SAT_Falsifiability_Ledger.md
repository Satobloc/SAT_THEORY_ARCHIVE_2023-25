## Falsifiable SAT Predictions

| Prediction | SAT Mechanism | Observable Signature | Falsifiability Criterion |
|------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Fixed optical phase shift across θ₄ kink | θ₄ domain wall: Δθ₄ = 2π/3 → sin²(θ₄) spike | Constant Δφ ≈ 0.24 rad across kink, independent of wavelength | If Δφ varies with wavelength or vanishes entirely |
| Click-frequency correlation with mass | f_click ∝ sin²(θ₄) | Inertial oscillators show higher frequency when more misaligned | If mass/frequency correlation fails or randomizes |
| Directional inertia (boost violation) | ψ field modulates uᵘ → anisotropic time flow | Particle motion resists time-aligned acceleration more than transverse | If inertial response is isotropic under θ₄ modulation |
| Decay synchrony in entangled or pre-bound systems | Tension-induced decay via θ₄, ∇·uᵘ, and future-bound τ | Temporal clustering of decay events | If decays remain Poissonian even under filament interaction structures |
| Defect trimer logic in moiré systems | τ fusion rule: τ₁ + τ₂ + τ₃ ≡ 0 mod 3 | Only τ-neutral defect clusters persist | If persistent violations of fusion rule occur without energy penalty |
| τ-dressed kink spectrum | Ψₖ(X₀, [A]) multiplet structure | Quantized energy splitting by τ sector | If kink energies remain degenerate across τ class |
| Time dilation-like behavior in θ₄-rich zones | θ₄-induced foliation strain slows clock rate | Atomic clocks tick slower near high-θ₄ structures | If no time dilation appears despite large θ₄ |
| Precursor frequency skew before decay/uncoiling | Cross-temporal tension affects early dynamics | Pre-event drift in click or clock phase | If no measurable precursor bias exists in matched configurations |

## Test Status Classification

- ✅ Testable with current tools (lab or astrophysics)
- ⚠️ Theoretically testable; environmental or statistical barriers exist
- ❌ Needs sharpening; currently too vague for strict falsifiability

## Immediate Deployment Candidates

1. **Optical Δφ vs wavelength** (interferometric test) – ✅  
2. **Mass–frequency click scaling** (ultra-cooled traps or BECs) – ⚠️  
3. **Moiré trimer constraint via STM data** – ✅  
4. **Clock drift near synthetic θ₄ gradients** – ⚠️  
5. **Search for decay event clustering in high-energy environments** – ⚠️

This ledger is meant to be expanded and version-controlled as test conditions evolve and predictions become sharper.
