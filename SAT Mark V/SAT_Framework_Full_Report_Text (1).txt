SAT Framework Research Report: Full Technical Overview
======================================================

I. Executive Summary
--------------------
Overview of SAT (Scalar-Angular-Twist) model:

SAT proposes a unification framework for physical fields using three fundamental components:
- θ₄(x): Angular field representing local rotational alignment
- uᵘ: Time-like foliation vector, indicating propagating wavefronts
- τ: Discrete twist variable enforcing fusion and topological rules

Epistemic principles:
- Falsifiability via simulation and empirical benchmarks
- Ontological commitments: structure via twist, time as wavefront
- Constructive retrodiction over curve-fitting
- Scientific accountability using adversarial agents (ConsensusPro) and SAT-naive validation

II. Theoretical Foundations
---------------------------
**Current State of SAT Theory**

- Lagrangian includes scalar-torsion couplings:
    L = ½(∂μθ₄)(∂^μθ₄) - μ² cos(3θ₄) + α(∇μuν)(∇^μu^ν) + λ(uᵘuᵘ + 1) + coupling terms with τ

- Constraints:
    φ₁ = uᵘuᵘ + 1 ≈ 0
    φ₂ = ∂ₜ(uᵘuᵘ) ≠ 0 ⇒ second-class constraints

**Generation of Existing Physics**

Mappings:
- Torsion in GR ↔ uᵘ constraint curvature
- Topological domains ↔ BEC solitons, ferroelastic kinks
- Discrete fusion ↔ Z₃ field theories and parafermions

**Retrodictions (Success/Failures)**

- ✔ Matches domain-wall energy density in layered BECs
- ✔ Predicts fringe compression patterns
- ✘ Partial failure in modeling composite charge interactions in twisted bilayers

**Predictions**

- Measurable Δφ in optical stacks (0.1 < Δφ < 0.3 rad)
- Confined defect propagation in twist-graded lattices
- Field-theoretic analogs in axially symmetric acoustics
