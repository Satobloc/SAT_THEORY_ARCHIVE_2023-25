True Predictions:
Public Pre-Registration of SAT-Based Predictions for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST)
Date: 2025-05-08 Time of Lock-In: 22:37 UTC Version: v1.0 Source: Derived via GPT-4, SAT-aligned analysis under user direction

Public Statement and Intent
This document records a set of explicit, falsifiable scientific predictions derived from an unreleased theoretical framework known as SAT (Scalar Angular Topology). The SAT model proposes that certain subtle anisotropies and twist-state constraints underlie the apparent geometry and dynamical behavior of space, time, and mass-energy interactions.
These predictions are being made prior to the full public release of relevant observational data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The purpose of this pre-registration is to:
	•	Lock in theoretical expectations in advance of any data mining, curve-fitting, or retrospective rationalization.
	•	Ensure scientific accountability, such that any eventual agreement or disagreement between model and observation is open to independent verification.
	•	Demonstrate the generative power of the SAT framework by proposing outcomes in domains where conventional models are either silent, vague, or yield null expectations.
We expect some of these predictions to be wrong, or only partially correct. That’s the point. Science advances by committing to the risk of being proven wrong—especially when extending beyond established paradigms. The results of this exercise, regardless of outcome, will be used to refine the theory and test its claims against reality.
This document constitutes a permanent record of SAT-aligned predictions, timestamped and unmodified since publication.

Locked Predictions for Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST)
(SAT Model v0.x, internal implementation)

Prediction 1: Cosmic Transparency Corridors
Strength: Strong Rubin will detect narrow angular bands (1°–5° wide) across the sky where galaxies of similar redshift appear brighter or dimmer than expected (by ~0.2–0.4 magnitudes), even after correcting for gravitational lensing, dust extinction, and known instrumental effects.
	•	Effects will be spatially coherent and persistent across observing bands.
	•	Residuals will correlate with celestial orientation, not large-scale mass distribution.

Prediction 2: Direction-Dependent Astrometric Drift
Strength: Strong High-precision proper motion data will show small but systematic angular drift (~0.1–0.3 mas/yr) in extragalactic sources (e.g. quasars), forming coherent dipole or quadrupole sky patterns unexplained by known kinematic frames.
	•	Residuals will be color-independent and persist across multiple observation seasons.
	•	Not attributable to known galactic rotation, solar reflex motion, or catalog bias.

Prediction 3: Time Dilation Anomalies in Repeating Transients
Strength: Moderate A class of repeating or quasi-periodic transients (e.g. flaring AGNs or exotic supernova analogues) will exhibit measurable deviations from standard redshift-based time dilation scaling, with systematic angular dependence.
	•	Timing deviations will be statistically robust after host correction.
	•	Not explained by extinction, gravitational lensing, or local peculiar velocities.

Prediction 4: Residual Shear Alignment in Weak Lensing
Strength: Strong Weak lensing shear maps will show residual anisotropies—specifically excess B-mode power or orientation bias—that remain after accounting for standard ΛCDM mass structures.
	•	Residuals will align with fixed celestial coordinates, not cosmic web topology.
	•	May manifest as low-ℓ alignment structure in shear orientation fields.

Prediction 5: Non-Gaussian Clustering in Fast Transient Sky Maps
Strength: Moderate Angular maps of rare high-energy transients (e.g. kilonovae, optical FRB counterparts) will show non-Gaussian clustering at low spherical harmonics (ℓ = 1–6), including potential Z₃ or Z₆ symmetry patterns.
	•	Clustering will not be attributable to survey geometry, cadence, or astrophysical bias.
	•	Will be visible in statistical analyses of rare transient angular distributions.
