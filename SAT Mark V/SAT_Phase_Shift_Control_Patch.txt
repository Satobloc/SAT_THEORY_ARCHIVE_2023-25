This document constitutes a formal prediction regarding the birefringent phase shift introduced by a θ₄ domain wall in a multilayer optical system. The following supplement is included to emphasize the contrast with classical models.


\section*{Classical Control Comparison}

To verify that the predicted phase shift is not a trivial outcome of bulk retardance, we consider a control stack with the same total optical path length, identical birefringent layers, and no angular domain wall (i.e., a uniform θ₄ configuration). In this classical case, the expected accumulated phase difference for linearly polarized light at 45° is governed entirely by the sum of optical retarders:

\[
\Delta\phi_{\text{classical}} = \sum_i \eta_i \sin^2\theta_{\text{const}} = \eta_{\text{eff}} \times L,
\]

where \( \eta_{\text{eff}} \) is uniform and L is the stack thickness. For θ constant (no domain wall), this yields a phase shift on the order of zero or a trivially small value depending on polarization alignment. This stands in stark contrast to the ~0.24–0.25 rad shift predicted when a θ₄-kink is introduced—an effect arising solely from the nonuniform angular profile across the domain wall. The presence of this fixed shift, independent of smooth material properties, constitutes a falsifiable deviation from standard Jones–Mueller optical theory.
