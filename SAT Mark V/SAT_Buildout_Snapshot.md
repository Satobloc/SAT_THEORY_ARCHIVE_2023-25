# SAT Framework: Phase I–II Internal Completion Snapshot
**As of May 2025 | Prepared for Nathan McKnight**  
*Modules completed without simulation, experiment, or datasets*

---

## I. Core Dynamics and Field Expressions

### 1. Click-Rate Function (f₍click₎)
- `f_click(x) = η · sin²(θ₄(x))`
- Governs inertial mass and clock rate for filament segments.
- Integrated along worldline to yield total tension → effective mass.

### 2. Newtonian-Like Force Law in SAT
- Effective force derived from misalignment gradients:
  `F = -η · sin(2θ₄) · ∇θ₄`
- Additional modulation via foliation divergence: `∇·uᵘ`

---

## II. Sector Classification and Excitations

### 3. Type-C Coil Excitation
- New sector: misaligned filaments with zero net Δθ₄, τ = 0
- Represents inertial bulges without topological charge
- Tagged as: `[C_ψ⁰]`

### 4. τ-Dressed Kink Wavefunctions (Ψₖ(X₀, [A]))
- Defined over: kink location X₀ and τ flux class [A] ∈ H¹(M, ℤ₃)
- Hamiltonian structure includes τ selection rules and potential splitting
- Wavefunction space: `L²(ℝₓ₀ × H¹(M, ℤ₃))`

---

## III. Composite Dynamics and Modulation

### 5. ψ–θ₄ Click Envelope Table
- ψ modulates θ₄-driven click frequency
- AM/FM behavior from ψ(t) fluctuations
- Leads to observable bursts, spikes, or metronomic tick trains

### 6. SAT Energy–Tension Law (E = mc² analogue)
- `E = ∫ sin²(θ₄) · ∇·uᵘ dx`
- Energy arises from geometric misalignment × foliation strain

---

## IV. Geometric Ontology and Field Roles

### 7. ψ as Vacuum Velocity Field
- ψ defines angular velocity of time slicing
- Interpreted as rapidity field of the foliation
- Encodes anisotropy, click skew, and inertial directionality

---

## V. Observables and Mapping Structures

### 8. Phase–Observable Table
- Maps θ₄, τ, and ψ to:
  - Optical Δφ
  - Mass (click rate)
  - Topological clustering (τ)
  - Inertial anisotropy (ψ)
- Sectors tagged with composite signatures for falsifiability

---

## VI. Scaling Behavior and Flow

### 9. Symbolic RG Flow
- Sine-Gordon-like flow for μ² with SAT corrections:
  `β_μ² = (2 - 9/2 · K_eff) μ²`
- τ and ψ introduce sector-dependent fixed points

---

## VII. Event Timing and Structural Instability

### 10. Tension-Induced Decay
- Decay occurs when:
  `T_decay = α·sin²(θ₄) + β·∇·uᵘ + γ·F_future ≥ T_threshold`
- Explains apparent randomness via hidden structural inputs
- Redefines τ₁/₂ as strain-weighted lifetime functional

**Next Launch-Ready Steps**:
1. Tag falsifiability tests (e.g., decay clustering, ψ-modulated click drift)
2. Build symbolic simulation scaffolds (e.g., SAT lattice evolution with tension rules)
3. Prepare experimental crosswalks (optics, GPS drift, pulsar timing)
