Based on the sources provided, here are the recommendations made regarding the development and testing of the Scalar–Angular–Twist (SAT) framework:
Recommendations for Theoretical and Mathematical Development:
	•	Cut the free knobs.
	•	Publish a full constraint/Hamiltonian analysis.
	•	Perform constraint analysis for the dynamics of uᵘ, projecting its dynamics onto the orthogonal subspace, computing the full set of primary/secondary constraints, and deriving positivity conditions on parameters α, κ, and β.
	•	Undertake 1+1D toy quantization of θ₄ with a frozen uᵘ background and static τ boundary twists. This could involve even a lattice simulation to see if domain walls carry the predicted Z₃ fusion statistics.
	•	Develop a clearer field-theoretic embedding for τ, such as a discrete gauge bundle or cohomological field, as current implementations risk treating τ as "meta-data".
	•	Handle uᵘ quantization carefully, perhaps via Dirac bracket formalism or projection tensors, as the vector field risks ghost modes due to its constrained dynamics.
	•	Pin down quantization paths for the framework, potentially via 1+1D toy models, Hamiltonian constraint analysis, or topological path integrals.
	•	Develop a minimal, fully solvable Lagrangian toy model.
	•	Develop either τ field dynamics or explicit implementation in lattice models or defect networks. A full theory for τ would likely require a propagating τ or topological field theory structure, such as a Dijkgraaf–Witten TQFT embedding.
	•	Nail down the discrete-gauge formalism for τ.
	•	Prove internal consistency of the uᵘ sector.
	•	Develop a Minimal Viable Lagrangian by stripping back to θ₄ + τ dynamical coupling in 1+1D, defining τ as a discrete 1-form gauge field with a BF term, and verifying soliton/domain-wall spectra.
	•	Reformulate the uᵘ kinetic term with the projector Pμν = gμν + uμuν to ensure orthogonality and avoid longitudinal instabilities for a Ghost-Free uᵘ Sector.
	•	Establish a Quantization Path for the coupled θ₄–uᵘ–τ system, exploring canonical quantization of θ₄ kinks in a toy model or setting up a path integral on a lattice of filaments with twist weights.
	•	Formalize τ as a dynamical discrete gauge field or TQFT variable.
	•	Clarify wavefront field uᵘ dynamics and stability.
	•	Draft minimal viable Lagrangians for θ₄–uᵘ–τ.
Recommendations for Experimental Testing:
	•	Run one decisive null-resilient lab test.
	•	Conduct an Optical stack benchmark test: Pick one layered birefringent sample, publish a pre-fit curve of phase delay vs. incidence angle that differs from standard wave-plate theory by ≥ 5 σ, and run it blind in an external lab.
	•	Ensure predictions yield numeric forecasts or bounded parameter estimates.
	•	Derive at least one numerical prediction, such as phase shift magnitude or angular mass variance.
	•	Carry through one unambiguous experimental test where only SAT predicts the outcome.
	•	Focus on a low-hanging fruit experiment, such as a layered birefringent photonic crystal, where you can independently tune an "alignment parameter" in simulation to predict a precise phase offset, then run the measurement blind.
	•	Develop more detailed quantitative modeling and simulation, including numerical solutions of the Euler–Lagrange equations or explicit predictions of mass distributions.
	•	Explicitly describe how each SAT prediction differs quantitatively or qualitatively from conventional theories (like GR, QFT, or standard cosmology) to establish Control Experiments.
	•	Identify low-cost, high-impact tests first as a pragmatic approach.
	•	Prioritize developing numerical predictions from the Lagrangian framework, explicitly connecting SAT parameters to measurable outcomes.
	•	Enhance Experimental Clarity by clearly documenting the conditions under which predictions could fail and identifying specific control experiments.
	•	Refine phenomenological predictions for concrete lab and cosmological tests.
	•	Map specific experimental predictions onto observable quantities.
	•	Frame critical tests and falsification criteria.
Recommendations for Methodological Approach:
	•	Follow the discipline sketched in the Round-table workflow.
	•	Pre-register a handful of high-leverage, low-parameter predictions.
	•	Invite hostile domain experts to try to break the predictions.
	•	Utilize a check-list culture (agenda, recording, outcome doc).
	•	Treat null results as model edits, not as reasons to add compensating terms, which helps keep the theory brittle in the Popperian sense.
	•	Maintain a minimal parameter count: Keep μ and one coupling constant fixed by a single datum and predict the rest. Log extra anomalies demanding new parameters as provisional until two independent observations converge.
	•	Ensure predictions remain strictly falsifiable, without ambiguities that allow "interpretive drift" or post-hoc rationalizations.
	•	Prioritize predictions, distinguishing core, high-impact ones from peripheral ones.
	•	Avoid "retrofitting" the theory to match known outcomes.
	•	Guard against epistemic insulation by actively courting adversarial or skeptical feedback.
	•	Remain ruthless about minimality, outside challenge, and not retrofitting failures.
	•	Focus initially on the most critical, easily falsifiable predictions through Selective Focus.
	•	Be prepared to discard scaffolding that fails in the face of hard data.
	•	Reduce the risk of model overfitting/scaffolding by developing and testing strict minimal models first.
	•	Run the model to failure.
By following these recommendations, the SAT framework can potentially move from an elegant prototype to a more rigorously tested and potentially viable contender.
