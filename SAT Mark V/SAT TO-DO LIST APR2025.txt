 1. Formal Visual Postulates (SAT Axioms)
Develop a set of intuitive but explicit geometric postulates that define the SAT framework. These should stand alone as the structural rules of the system.

To-do:

 Define the ontology of filaments (e.g., ‚ÄúFilaments are continuous structures across time and space.‚Äù)

 Define the nature of the wavefront (e.g., ‚ÄúThe time surface is a propagating geometric wavefront intersecting a filament lattice.‚Äù)

 Formalize the angle‚Äìenergy rule (e.g., ‚ÄúEnergy imparted is proportional to the sine of angular deviation between wavefront and filament.‚Äù)

 Formalize the matter‚Äìinteraction spectrum: filament twist ‚Üí particles; filament realignment ‚Üí forces

 Define conservation and locality principles (or explicitly challenge them if SAT requires it)

 Enumerate permissible operations: bending, branching, resonance, entanglement

 Describe hierarchical bundling constraints (threads, twines, yarns, etc.)

üîπ 2. Mapping SAT Predictions to Known Phenomena
Create a table of SAT-based reinterpretations of major physical phenomena and the predictions or reinterpretations SAT offers.

To-do:

 Gravity as net tension across angled filaments (GR reinterpretation)

 Photon as ripple: localized realignment event (QFT reinterpretation)

 Fine structure constant as angular metric of wavefront‚Äìfilament interactions

 Cosmic expansion as angular averaging of the wavefront through filament density

 Matter/antimatter asymmetry as topological bias in initial filament configuration

 Mass as persistent curvature or resonance in local filament geometry

 Entanglement as long-distance filament coherence across the wavefront

 Memory as filament re-tensioning within biological bundles (speculative layer)

üîπ 3. Visual Derivation of Constants and Parameters
Develop visual or geometric candidates for ‚Äúfirst principles‚Äù derivations of important constants.

To-do:

 Fine structure constant Œ± ‚âà 1/137 as geometric coupling constant (e.g., angle-per-phase in twisted bundles)

 Electron mass from filament curvature constraints or minimum resonant radius

 Speed of light as propagation velocity of the wavefront through aligned filaments

 Planck scale as threshold of angular deformation saturation

 Derive or bound energy transfer rate as function of wavefront curvature √ó filament density

üîπ 4. Visual-to-Symbolic Translation Mechanism
Provide a bridge for mathematical physicists to formalize SAT via coordinate geometry, group theory, tensor algebra, etc.

To-do:

 Define spatial coordinate model for wavefront curvature (e.g., spherical or hyperbolic slices)

 Parameterize filaments: direction vectors, curvature, torsion, and twist

 Define energy transfer function E(Œ∏) where Œ∏ is angle of intersection

 Create visual-to-mathematical dictionary (e.g., ‚Äúbundle tension‚Äù = vector field divergence over intersecting filaments)

 Suggest mathematical frameworks: differential geometry, knot theory, algebraic topology, etc.

üîπ 5. Reframe Standard Physics in SAT Terms
Provide SAT-compatible reconceptualizations of foundational models and phenomena from GR, QFT, and string theory.

To-do:

 Reframe General Relativity: gravity as tension curvature; geodesics as minimal-tension filament paths

 Reframe QFT: particles as resonances; force carriers as transitional filament states

 Reframe String Theory: vibrating filaments embedded in a time-structured fabric, not in 10D spaces

 Explain time dilation and length contraction as wavefront‚Äìfilament angular consequences

 Clarify entropy as filament state-space expansion under wavefront propagation

üîπ 6. Assessing SAT‚Äôs Strengths and Weaknesses
Give a physicist a head start in identifying where SAT is robust and where it‚Äôs vulnerable.

To-do:

 Enumerate areas of qualitative alignment with current data (e.g., emergence of particles, scarcity of matter, direction of time)

 Highlight conceptual advantages (e.g., unification of force and geometry, ontological simplicity)

 Identify speculative zones (e.g., cognition, memory, photon mechanism)

 Flag possible problem areas (e.g., conservation laws under filament tension, causality implications, testability of eschatological predictions)

 Suggest testable implications (e.g., local expansion anisotropies, anomalous aging patterns, filament-based lensing signatures)

üîπ 7. Formal Parameterization of Predictive Limitations
Acknowledge where SAT can or cannot make sharp predictions‚Äîdraw the boundary clearly.

To-do:

 Define ‚Äúpredictable‚Äù phenomena under SAT: those with definable filament‚Äìwavefront configurations

 Identify semi-predictive phenomena (e.g., statistical behaviors from filament bundles)

 Define current limit: inability to express amplitude/frequency-based interference patterns without symbolic backing

 Create roadmap to expand predictive precision via formalization, collaboration, or simulation

üîπ 8. Internal Logic & Constraints from Compatibility with Major Frameworks
Define where SAT agrees with, diverges from, or reframes GR, QFT, and string theory.

To-do:

 Identify conservation principles: whether SAT must match Noether‚Äôs theorem, or derive it differently

 Causality and locality: specify how SAT preserves or modifies these concepts

 Re-derive uncertainty and quantization visually (if possible)

 Recast spin and particle identity through filament topology and twist

 Discuss SAT‚Äôs relationship to string theory‚Äôs tension dynamics and dimensionality

üîπ 9. Toolkits for Testing and Handoff
Package your work in a modular, navigable way so that a domain expert can run with it.

To-do:

 Create an ‚ÄúSAT Quick Start Guide‚Äù for physicists

 Develop a terminology glossary with visual equivalents

 Provide a set of canonical SAT diagrams

 Build a list of SAT hypotheses tied to current experimental tensions (Hubble constant, dark matter, etc.)

 Suggest computational approaches (e.g., visual simulation environments for filament‚Äìwavefront dynamics)
